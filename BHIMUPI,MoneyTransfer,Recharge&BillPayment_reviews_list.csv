krishna rai,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Jun-20,"As I knew this platform from very earlier, yes very easy to use this app, need to update time to time, and my suggestion is to add one more feature to pay bill/insurance for LIC OF INDIA, it's huge in demand so people don't have to switch on other app for this purpose only, pls do it ASAP, thank you"
Sb,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,"Worst app, I recharged for 365/- and it is more than 48 hours and it is not recharged but amount has been deducted. Customer care is showing that recharge is successful and they suggesting to contact service provider. If that was the case then why I need ur app for recharge. Guys don't install."
JD SPECIAL,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,Awesome app ( 6N73RE ) At first I thought it was going to be like Subway Surfers but then I went through the portal and it changed the music and I was jamming why I was playing princess Surfers this is the greatest game I think it's even better than Subway Surfers but I don't know what is a 5-star rating for me. There are so many ways to go. The thing I like the most is the skateboards. The lady characters wear such a flashy and wonderful costume. I just love this game
Bijoy Roychowdhury,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,"Cashback and promotions often don't work , despite following instructions and reading T&C. Support section will not give you a explanation or solution. UPI payment UI is bad, transactions often fail despite good internet. Update:number of useful vendors where you can use ""Supercash"" had reduced. Don't bother even trying to earn the Supercash. They won't let you use it."
Jitesh Ff,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,"This App is amazing! ( 6 N 7 3 R E ) It is a great game for you and your kid/kids to have lots of fun spending time together. If you have never played a game like this before you might be a bit confused. You have to swap candy's and get three in a row or more! This game can be addicting but in a good way. It is also a relaxing game to play on long journeys! They have sure improved this game. I loved it in its original form, then it got changed and, I thought, more a game for small kids."
kn singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Jun-20,"This app is quite complecated . What is super cash and points , I could not understands. Why don't you make the thing , simple ? Simplify the interface of this app . It is quite troublesome and I don't like it . Please , delink my s/b accounts with this app . I am unable to do it."
rahul mandal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,Very bad app my wallet balance have did not get back to my account and the reason is interesting if you are sending money from wallet then carefully check the number because if the number does not have account then also money has sending through wallet. If the number not resiter on this app then also why money send success to any unknown number
Md Rashid,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,24-Jun-20,"What a nice app for everyone to earn a lot of wallet money as well as redeem it easily at any platform if he or she, understand to use this application.Using this application for earning money, is little bit complex but it gives much earnings once it's understood by anybody.Its customer care services is very supportive for its customers.Claiming any issue in this app is very easy process and it is solved within the time as per its terms & conditions."
CrazyButNotEazy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,This app sucks.. because I have tried to recharge my number of 599 and recharge failed. ..it was showing..failed but money added to wallet.but once I checked there was no money ..try to get help through transaction..but there is no history of failed transaction..I have tried to call.the available number no response..I have tried to recaharge through flip kart and it's redirected me to your website now I didn't got my recharge or..refund..in history it showing success but recharge is failed.
Ajith,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,Using this App again after long time....This app is really awesome now... interface and lot of changes has been done..espically the UPI request which shows in main screen and the invoice for the payment is really good and helpful...where in other Apps I should search..one thing I don't like is supercash.....but I would 100% recommend this app to my friends. If invoices was Available in PDF format that would have been a great update..
Kunal Mallick,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,"Its very to pity to say but this app sucks , literally !! The app crashes multiple times and takes even 15 or 30 to just to open . The UPI payments stucks and even fails multiple times . Devs !! Do something man or else you guys just gonna out of the race !"
Pooja Ji,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,Really amazing app ( 6 N 7 3 R E ) This is the best game I ever played . This is best shooting game but some times it shows signal did not responding but I love this game so much the best part of this game is that when we play the game for long time in a day it shows a notification for take some rest which is very good for our eyes I think this is world game I give this game 5 star ratting The best game ever I play.I have play since 2 years ago and we can get free bc using videos.
Shubham Singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Jun-20,"I am really disappointed with this app it does not have any customer care option in this app. And why I can't deregister or remove my link bank account, And your app always shows (it seems your bank is experiencing problems pls try after some time) my bank is working properly it seems your app is experiencing problems. At the time of linking to my bank account it took 1 sec but now to remove it looks like it would take a year, many customers report same issue butl you have proved not to change"
Mukul Chhabra,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,"One of the most worst app i ever used Mobikwik do not allow to Deregister UPI id and also i want to remove my linked bank account but everytime it says ""It seems your bank is experiencing problem. Please try Later"". What is this MobiKwik? Every other UPI supported app runs smoothly but only Mobikwik has issues. Please solve the problem as quockly as possible."
Kalyan Bhattacharjee,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,The app was quite good till now. However recently I noticed that I cannot add a BSNL individual landline connection..... Even after entering the correct consumer number it says that the information is INCORRECT.... Previously this system was working fine please take time to fix such issues quickly
Abhishek David,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,"Offers are only for first time users, everytime I tried to make a credit card payment the offers shows are only for first time users. If it is not available then why it shows in my acount. Very poor services."
SUHEL SHEKH,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,"I rate it 1 star because when I want to delete my saved card .this option is not available and the customer support service is very poor of mobikwik. Pls improve your app like other app like phonepe. When we want to delete any thing from your app like saved debit, credit card."
Surendra juttika,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Jun-20,One of the worst app in the play Store with poor customer service. I made a recharge of 149 twice and money deducted from my account but i didn't received the recharge . They shows a message that your money was credited in to your account but didn't received the amount even after 7days.
Sangamesh Hiremath,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,10-Jun-20,"The clutter in the homepage. Esp the scan to pay option looks like a treasure hunt. The payment always fails. I tired Citi, ICICI etc banks all of them failed saying bank is busy. I checked on other apps and all the banks' gateways worked fine. Please fix this else it won't be useful as wallet anymore."
Pintu Ghanti,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Jun-20,"Its a very very bad app. In here i using mobile recharge, bt form walet money is deduct bt recharge not done. & no suporting team or help desk r not available.

Vasant Dhole,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,I had a very bitter experience with this app . I had transferred RS.25000 through Mobikwik to my Zebpay account. Both Mobikwik and Zebpay too shows amount credited. But I don't found the amount still actually creadited to my Zebpay Bitcoin. It's still after 4 days. Can I solve this dispute.? Can I take back to be credited to my Zebpay Bitcoin the amount which not really credited ? Please guide me.
Gaurav Singh,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,"Today I was made a recharge which transaction had became pending, I raised a ticket regarding that an I got notification that recharge couldn't be succeeded so we made recharge again a second amount but after that both became successful. Now how-to recover my loss due to your default. It's never happened in PhonePe which I use from long time."
SABITA SHARMA,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,19-Jun-20,"The over all use is quite good but when it comes to get the refunded amount, at that time the whole complications arrive. When ever the merchant refunded my amount, the whole refunded amount didn't reflect in the wallet every time a lesser amount reflects."
khan consultancy MBBS Abroad,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,It is really amazing app. I request to all peoples please use this. I big feature in this app. I tell you when phone pe or paytm show transaction failed then u used this app and put upi id of the person then in just 2 second transaction would be successfully.

Nitin Varshney,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Jun-20,"I do recharge 399 by using upi, after some processing it shows some error and recharge not happened also money deducted from my account. Trying so many times to connect in customer care but every time call disconnected. Worst money transfer app ever."
Shraddha Varani,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,"This is so pathetic, I have my loans going through a partner that's is linked to Mobikwik. Now as once I have updated the app, the instant loan option tells me to refill all the information as befor for the first time I have applied for the loan. The app is not showing me any such feature for help neither no customer care number is there for direct contact. I also wanted to apply for my next moratorium request but I can't as the app is not showing me my existing loans details and moratorium link"
Harish Govekar,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,24-Jun-20,I recharged for my Vodafone number but it didn't showed up. Then I had to use other means for recharge. It totally wasted my time and money. Even when I initiated complaint they are saying it was done successfully which is wrong. They didn't even give my refund.
Gul Nawaz,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,Bad exp. With mobikwik. My seceuirty pin is blocked in 5-5-2020 and i submit required documents to mobikwik.

Kunal Sharma,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,"After my first transaction, I can say, it's working good for me. I hope, I will not have to change my review for this app. You guys will always give me good service..right. A mistake in a month is acceptable but if it exceeds, that means the job is not being taken seriously. You can decide now where you stand. Good luck 🐎"
Shambhukumar Sonar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,"I am raising concern since last one year through App as I am unable to do KYC through Aadhar( Error-account linked with another). However, technical team from Mobi are still unable to resolve and I am unable do transactions through this App. What a App and Technical Team! Shabby and hateful App and Technical Team."
Sneha Gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,"This app fools you about super cash which people usually understand of direct cash back provided to your account but after transaction you came to know that super cash also needs to turn into cash which is approximately 1/3 of their so called super cash. Also once you have added your bank account in it and when you tries to remove it, it says there is a problem in your bank however it is not so. This app make you total fool."
Deepak PS,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,Had the worst experience ever . From KYC verification to fund transfer this app suck to the core .

Yogesh Bhende,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,03-Jun-20,Best app to use specifically I like the Supercash idea. This app is not like other apps where we can't get some discounts while recharging and bill payment. Just want to add one thing to include dark mode in the app.

ARPIT VERMA,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Jun-20,"**ALERT FAKE **DO NOT USE**SCAM**UNINSTALL** Guys please do not install this application for services, this is completely fake. If your bank account is registered with this application, they will automatically debit any amount from your account and will give you silly excuses on the same. First of all there is no support for help in this app, if by luck you get help and complains about the issue, they will not listen and will behave rude with you finally will make customer as a fool to use app."
AMEER ASHAREF,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Jun-20,"Imps done, not transfer to account, deduct from wallet, after 2 days no response from mobikwik. Mailed and raise complaint in app. There is no solution from this developer. Still my money not credited or refunded after 8th working day"
asha kumari,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,Worst App...you can never catch hold of customer care in this app..they will keep saying that you can't raise ticket after 12 hours....if you really want to risk your money..go ahead...technology is so bad that your money will be debited and the other person won't receive it...and your money is deducted...and no active customer care exists...now keep wondering ..how to get money back...Don't go on star rating...I am sure they themselves manipulating the rating. Through agents of their own.

Jishnu Alathumpara,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,One of the best app for recharging... I very like mobikwik.. Some improvement required in upi section...

nikhilesh gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,"I used my promo code, after successfully transaction, they told upgrade your details.. No cash back there..

Inder Jeet,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,Very poor app they run refer and earn orogramme but donot provide cashback. Even they are not replying. Very bad costumer care support. Non working email id. No way to contact them.

Saurabh Andurlekar,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,The Application is great in terms of paying bills and money transfer. Everything is very fast and hassel free. Needs more improvement on support portal because sometimes the problem goes unanswered.

It's time to delete this useless app from my phone. I will never recommend this useless app to any of my friend. Refund back my money.
Shivam Pandit,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-20,The app doesn't always have a dependable service whereby it is most likely to be unavailable when you actually need to make a transfer. The SuperCash functionality is something which I didn't really like. Not recommended in comparison to other payment applications out there.
F K,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,Total out dated... Other apps give Cash back very quickly.. But this app valueless.. I recharge many times with valid promo code.. but this app does not give Cash back yet...

MANOJ KUMAR,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,03-Jun-20,"The option to de-register a UPI account does not work, it always states an error, UPI does not de-register without changing the mobile number. The option to delete the previous primary number does not work. This problem does not go away even after reinstalling the Mobikwik app and logging in to another mobile, fix it soon. On contacting the customer support service, incorrect information is given, a lot of waiting has to be done."
akilan aki,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Jun-20,"Unable to update my profile for wallet benefits. Unable to recharge any number and everytime I try recharging I get ""Something went wrong"" error. This is frustrating."
value to money tech,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-20,It is better than payment app. It is because you can get supercash and you can easily earn some money on any recharge.
Dhruval patel,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-20,"Worst application of the year, I have done recharge of ₹ 399 money debited but recharge not receive it's 2 day, and not taking responsibility for that saying contect your sim card company we have done recharge successfully from our side"

Glynis Lamb,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,I hate this app. I lost money using this app. There's no real time customer service number where one can lodge a service complaint for unsuccessful money transactions and subsequent reimbursement. Communication via bot is a waste of time! Seriously....this app is dangerous when it comes to money transfers. Beware!
Hari,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,"When making payment through mobikwik wallet, no sms is being send as confirmation. This is very much required for tracking the spends using other sms based apps. Please fix it"

Aditya Gaurav,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-May-20,This is a fraud app. They always receive the money from users and didn't complete the transactions. There is no features of contacting them. No email . No helpline number nothing. This happened to me 3 times. So i decided to rate this app. Be alert . Don't install this app. You can enjoy so many other apps.
nishant maurya,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,04-Jun-20,It is very smooth conducting and better than other similar apps. The best part is that you can register any other mobile number too.
Rupsha Chakraborty,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,I have done a recharge of 485 My bank deducted the money but this app showed that the recharge is failed and I have lost my money When I try to make a complaint there is no way to do that successfuly
mentally shrewd,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,"I haven't seen any financial app to be so disgusting, poor quality and complicated like mobikwik. When ever I made any mobile recharge it takes hour to confirm your recharge. And if by chance your recharge decline.. then the money which debited from UPI account is credited to mobikwik wallet which could not be added to bank.. If you want to tranfer it to bank it asks for 5% tax.. If it were possible I would rate it zero.. Mobikwik delink my sbi account .."
Manoj 1199 Manoj,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,24-Jun-20,"I entered wrong number ,but recharge was done and amount was taken from my wallet 😣 worst appp ,when call to that number it was telling it is a wrong number"
SHA M,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-May-20,"Very Bad UI. When opening App 1. Everytime asks for full KYC. Click back, asks for continue/No thanks. Click No thanks again KYC page appears. Click back again to go to home page. 2. Can't exit the app easily either. Click back asks for are you sure you want to exit. Click yes but App doesn't close and need to click back again. Who is that Great App designer who made this App so sticky ? Is Mobikwik expecting users to Use only this App and nothing else ?"
Sayan Sinha,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,"Worst payment app in the history. Full of bugs and fradulents, doesn't reward cashback even after hosting offers."

Soban Khan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-May-20,"This App Sucks in many ways, 1. They deducted amount for the recharge which was I get failed option. 2. They don't show the record of the failed transaction, I am unable to check failed transaction, which is already deducted from my account. 3. No customer support on app. Seriously only some FAQs which are literally not a single one is helping. Lastly, in 2016 when I was unistalled this just because of the very same problem and after 4 years they are still the same but with UPI."
madhav shinde,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-20,The app only give offer but then offers are not converted into cashback. The offer no mobiwik are fake they didn't give cashback only show off.

kruti Fozdar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-May-20,"BEWARE, DO NOT USE THIS APP! Had very bad experience upon installing. when I tried to select a bank (SBI), the process of updating my account profile with bank (of online transaction authorization) was not complete, so instead of giving me a message to that effect, the app AUTOMATICALLY SELECTED ANOTHER BANK, WHERE I DID NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNT BUT OTHER FAMILY RELATIVE DID ,(who had to give my SIM NUMBER due to not having a local number at the time). THIS IS VERY SERIOUS ACTION BY APP."
Vishnu Vijayan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-May-20,"It's like a hell...lagging in every aspect, not even having a customer care support team good at solving issues rapidly and the customer care number shown in google is switched off or not reachable whenever we try to reach them...it's so bad... My last issue was like this... When i proceeded some recharge, my money was deducted but it was not reflected in benificiary account when i try to get help...my transaction was not even seen within my transaction history...is'nt funny...!"
sindhu s,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,Worst app in terms of service and not a user friendly app and i suggest you guys not even dare to think to lend money from this app. Disgusting and fraudulent. Expecting a call from their team or else will be spreading the same all over the social media.
Chakri Vemu,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,"Bad experience. Transaction failed, money got debited but not refunded back. There's no transaction showing in transaction page."

Sowjanya Nellipudi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,Waste customer support. I have raised a complaint and they are not at all resolving the actual problem.

Argha Chaudhuri,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,Reward limit is too low and very complicated. I got 88 supercash which I have to convert to wallet balance but I can redeem only 10 supercash per month that means I need 9 months to redeem it. Actualy they didn't want to give any reward that is why they take this type of complicated procedure.
Technical Ninja,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,This app deserve less than 0 star .. there customer care services is very bad ...

Anna Rao,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-Apr-20,"వేస్ట్ ఆప్. Waste app. Don't download. A gimmick in other words a type of cheating. Cashback is in otheform, Supercash. Its not cash... It won't be useful. A little amount of the points equivalent to Rs.5 or10 would be converted into cash once in a month. Remaining accumulated points would be not useful. So pls don't download this app."
Nirman Kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,08-Apr-20,"This is the worst app if your pin got blocked as i am following from last 2 months , no satisfactory response comes from the customer care executive. Reset platform is not correct like other online app. Also toll free no is not responding I have tried 10 times in a day for 3 days. But no response. Kindly make a good platform and handy to user."
Gummadi Giri,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-May-20,"App keeps lagging and crashing. Device is getting warmer while using this app. All the processes like mobile number verification, adding money to wallet are slow and laggy. This app took 2 minutes to process mobile recharge request and failed. Money was debited from the bank account but recharge was not processed. Very uncomfortable and irritating app layout and performance. I always face trouble with this app. And so, I decided to quit using this app 😠😤😡"

Shreyansh Goyal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-May-20,I made a bill payment yesterday only but i am not able to see that transaction and wondering where that money go because it has been successfully debited from my debit card. This is cheating and with no customer care to solve the problem it's very difficult to continue with this app. Other e-wallets have dedicated team to solve problems and here mobikwik is useless. Do not download they steal your money.
Mohamed Riazullah,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,Amount debited from account but not credited.. the wallet also showing 0 balance.. No proper help desk to raise the complaint please check and let me know.

gokul sellapandy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,mobikwik customer care support is very poor...and i want to terminate or de activate my account...They are not responding....very poor service..upi service is also very poor in the app.You cant deregister upi bank accounts.it shows bank server not responding for 2 days...They Are cheating guys.I think they try to stole our bank datas.i recommend dont try mobikwik app..it has no cashback...super cash is very difficult to understand..App has lot of ads..I may say worst mobile recharging tillnow.
Harshal Kadam,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,16-Jun-20,Truly a great app. It recommend policies which are cheaper and very often needed compared to other apps which recommend some stupid coupons
Tushar Purohit,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Jun-20,"Unable to recharge Jio phone 75 plan. Every time it says ""this plan is only for jio phone user"". Then tell me how to convey mobikwik that I am using jio phone."

Rokey Rox,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,24-May-20,"There must be an option to select if I want to use my wallet balance or not. While paying electricity bill I wanted to pay through debit card as I didn't have sufficient amount on wallet, but the remaining balance on my wallet also included in the payment option and I can't unselect it. As like paytm there must be the option whether I want to use my wallet money or not. This is frustrating."
Nafees Siddiqui,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,31-May-20,Amzing App for tranfering money frm wallet to bank.. far better than paytm in terms of charges for adding money using credit.. Paytm charges 2% for adding moneg using credit card and also if someone wants to transfer money from paytm to bank it chages more than mobikwik... conclusion this app is far better and must have app for needy people..
bubai mukherjee,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,This APP is good but when i transfer money any other bank it should be so many chargeable..
PRABHAT KUMAR,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Apr-20,"Worst Financial App... Doesn't even allow to deactivate or delete account. Not allowing to raise ticket for any problem. Even mail is not reaching the support email Id saying inbox is full, what kind of financial transactions they could do...Resolve the issues at the earliest. Be sincere to your customers. Don't create trap like 'Aaye apni marzi se jo but jaoge hamari marzi se'. Who does this these days?"
Stanley,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-May-20,This app is not a trusted app because there is no costemer center regarding this app. Existing numbers do not work.

So please don't use this app.
Vaibhav Sharma,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,23-Apr-20,"Within 24 hours of emailing about the problem , the refund is provided. Very nice customer support.

Wish I could use on bigger platforms like Amazon, flipkart etc. And also there should be atleast 10% usage limit per transaction for Supercash."
Ankit Khandelwal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Apr-20,Worst app ever no response from customers care after raising many tickets.

Once my 10000 amount got deducted from wallet but didn't get transferred to my account. I raised a ticket and that got solved in just one day. Those who are facing similar issue and hasn't got any solution, please make sure you are raising your complaint against the actual failed transaction. I raised a request against a successful transaction and wasted my 3-4 days."
Pulkit Sharma Premium Videos,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-May-20,There is no customer care phone number. Only endless ticket numbers. No proper response.

sagar rao,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-May-20,Never ever use this app to purchase or take loan. Worst customer service. Having been trying to reach them for months and nobody cares to respond.

When asked no one cares to respond or reply to emails.

Whenever I add money, it never gets credited to the wallet but the amount gets debited from my account. There is absolutely no customer support to report the matter.

Ferejul Rahaman,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,24-May-20,Nice app for recharge and bill payment. But sometimes it's take too much time to complete the transaction even you have full internet connection. And one more thing is that most of the cashback is received by supercash which you can't invest all coins in oneday......
Sansar Garg,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-May-20,I am editing this review as my issue got resolved after trying so hard and reminding them continuously but not satisfied with the help section as they have no contact details provided also just generate help ticket ID which is very lathergic way carried by them and queries remain unanswered for a very long time.

ashni chumber,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-May-20,Why there is no support for customer care I understand now it's lockdown going but last year I also done the recharge it was not processed and money was deducted. After wait still recharge was not done as well as no refund. Plz update your app by adding customer care option so whenever there is a problem we can call or mail for that. As I have checked all of your reviews on playstore all are negative mostly. You need to work on your app for adding customers care option for bettter results

Kamal Pokhrel,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,24-May-20,For payment it is good but referral programme is only to attract more users they don't give you your referral earning.so recommend don't refer because you will not get anything. I had contacted them but they make excuses that you haven't completed the criteria.but i had done accordingly. 3 star is for referral programme.
ravi teja,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-May-20,"Wish there was a option to not give even a 1 star. Transaction failed at merchant but amount not refunded back to wallet even after a day. Customer service is pathetic. No response at all, several people gets assigned on chat but no one responds. Finally got a ticket# 14996367 and as expected not a single response. I now regret the decision to use Mobikwik, which won't be the case further. I will make sure to pass this experience to all my known folks. Good luck in making them stay..."

manik sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-May-20,"They told me to wait for one month for loan availablitly and after one month today, when i applied with all my KYC done and all details positive. They rejected my loan with no reason and mentioned there to apply one month later. Even they just do not tell the reason against rejection. I advice all to dont waste time here. They trap people by various offers which they dont apply like loan and all and make profit with their initial services like bills, recharges etc. Dont trust. Find other way."

Guys take care of your wallet & card details. Even, I doubt mobikwik itself has done the fraud and worried that they may misuse my card details. Note: even I reached the feedback team as they requested here, but no use"

Prafful Bansal,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,30-Mar-20,"The app UI and payment experience is fantastic. I am giving one star less because you don't give an option to edit UPI VPA. By default VPA contains phone no. of the user while in other UPI apps you can edit your UPI VPA. The problem is this that sometimes I don't want to share my mobile no. with the other person and I provide my UPI VPA. I hope you will look in this meaningful suggestion. Otherwise, this app is a one stop solution for every financial need. Well done Mobikwik team! 👌"

SANJAY MALHOTRA,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Feb-20,This app is not having a good customer support system. From the help section you are assured to get reply with in 24 hours but they will reply after 2 days and that reply will be very unsatisfactory. They ask you for sharing screenshot but there is no way for sending it. The app is totally fake and deserved only 1 star rating
Shailendra Kumar,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Feb-20,"Very very fast during payment of railway tatkal ticket while other wallets take some delay but mobikwik is fastest which may be due to it's less network traffic or high server maintenance. In every update they should clearly share that what special improvement is done( and in which features) instead of writing ""Multiple bug fixes and performance improvement"" only.Thanks."

HIMANSHU JAKHAR,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Feb-20,"Really, Too slow application please don't make any transaction with this they're only use our money for their personal problems, it's why because when we are going to payment money dedicated from bank account but they didn't pay to target person, and if payment refunded we got our payment in 20 to 25 days...

Sagar Khatri,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,They say they'll give ₹100 Supercash but then they don't put up a message that you can only use 5% of the cash. It's a lame way to make money and this is my last transaction with mobikwik.Phonepe and Paytm are far better because they genuinely tell you how much cash you get and how much you can use(full in this case).No doubt why mobikwik can't make money against their competitors.They fail to build the trust with their users. Funding won't make sense if you don't know how to run business.Fail.

alpana gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-May-20,I don't like its supercash scheme. There are many Apps which give better offers and cashback get in wallet. May be Mobikwik found something new with supercash feature but it irritates. It allow to use only 5℅ of this supercash as a discount and converting supercash in wallet money is superfrustating feature because of its nonsense conditions which gives you at last only 7 rupees per month. If someone want to use Mobikwik then one has to ignore cashback.

Guys don't be cheated by using this waste aapp."

A Google user,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,02-Jan-19,Its just a waste...other wallets provide you direct cashback but here you have to scratch your cards and you'll have one after so many days.. going to the app 100 times a day and check if the cards are available or not..i think no-one has that much of time in today's busy schedule..and even if you get ur cards to get scratched it will provide 5 10 bucks. Now think how many times you have to scratch if you have 100 points to convert it into cash...just dont go for it...

Couldn't find a good review 😂😂 Everyone has very bad experience So , couldn't give it more than 1*"
Abhinav Mishra,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,12-Dec-18,One good thing about the app is that it did not ask me for unnecessary privileges but the concept of supercash is a fraud. It's redemption is delibrately restrictive so that you never get to use it. And they expire in 3 months. Well it took me some time to find the finer details but now no longer using the app. Every other wallet has either cashbacks or nothing. I like the two options. Uninstalling this app as it makes u feel u are saving on ur transactions when u can hardly use any of the savings.
Prashant Yadav,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Jan-19,Worst app.. they usually take 48 hours to reflect payment which is not the case with Google Pay and Paytm.. and if you get stuck with a problem the great thing is you cant even call them you have to wait for their text reply which usually takes more than 12 hours.. i rechargedy tata sky and i am still waiting for the recharge to happen after 39 hours.. and their text message help is not of much help.. so i suggest all other people to dont waste time here..
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Mar-19,"Suggestion:- if I lost my mobile any one reach my wallet. It is a big lack of mobikiwik 1 :- auto fill my mobile number in logging ID. 2 :- auto verification(self generated OTP) and quick login in wallet without any security. It is a big lack of mobikiwik.

This happens everytime one tries to pay bills. Their customer care is never available via call, and they do not repond to messages. They reply based on their whims and fancies. I will file a case in consumer court."

Specifically Random,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,16-Mar-19,"It's not what it looks like. I got Rs80 cashback through Myntra app but this cashback was in the form of 'super cash'. so to transfer supercash into your wallet you have to buy Rs10 coins, this coin will buy you a scratch card. for instance if you have got Rs7 after scratching Rs10 card and now you want to transfer this money into your bank, well you can't. why? because you need minimum 400 bucks to do that.

Karthik MT,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Sep-18,"My account security pin is blocked due to wrong pin entered by me, So that i raised more tickets and i attached all supporting documents (as they asked) to unblock the security pin, But still again they're asking the same documents, There's no one not solved my issues still, I'm not a new customer to mobikwik so. Finally i don't know what to do now?"
hashim ansari,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Feb-19,sorry guys earlier i said this is awesome app but to be very frank app is not responding properly. Today is my last day to pay electricity bill. yesterday i have tried to pay bill three times all the time message was showing not successfull because of some error. then i check all the time my balance has been deducted from wallet. after registering request its almost a day gone and i dont have any response. now i am very confuse to pay from anothet app or to wait for refund or bill payment
Green Country,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,31-Dec-18,really internal solving team are not working good this app has so many issues not good to use and team is not responding properly .Help options are worst kindly be fast to solve the issue which is necessary. help options team are not solving any queries simple telling resolved.for bank verification i am trying from 15 days not yet resolved ..good work i am impressed
Amit Verma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Oct-18,Your application is worst. I added 5200 in my wallet. Now the app doesn't allow me to transfer to my friend's wallet or in bank account. Now what to do with your app and wallet. It's shows KYC not updated and the beauty is it also not allowed to update kyc. Everytime shows this service is currently not available. What to do?
himani surana,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Dec-18,"Not suggested app.Firstly, very small monthly limits of Rs 10000 pm which can only be increased by visiting nearest kyc centre. To my surprise no kyc centre in a big city like kolkata and so we can't even make payments beyond 10k per month.. I had to pay for my flight tickets & couldn't pay for more than 1 person because of this limit. Secondly, an amount of rs 7000 was refunded on flight booking cancelation & such huge bank acc transfer charges which they don't charge on adding to lure customers"
Nishant Roy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Dec-18,"My phone, my data, my PREROGATIVE whether to root it or not. Actually rooting it helps me keep control of what I share with your and other apps who want a bucket load of permissions which are not relevant for app. The app won't run, and I don't care to use it anymore. UNINSTALLED! Realise that it is Power users who give the most word of mouth publicity."
KRISH VAMA,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,31-Oct-19,"There is no pop-up window for entering date of birth , one have to go through all years which he passed through, hope you understood.

I have sent amount from my wallet which has not been accepted by the receiver, don't know why it's taking so long to retrieve or crediting back the same amount to my wallet. For how long more your office will sleep on this issue, no response, you think my money has no value. It's so unethical on your part that till now there is no update from you."
Nirudra Kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jan-20,"Successfully applied promo code, but didn't receive the cashback three or more times.

anmol raina,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,Worst experience and customer service... Money got deducted multiple times and no proper customer care to raise the request .. Only you get the notification that we will get back to you in 24 hrs...

I request the team to fix this error."
silvester bruno,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Apr-19,"It says cashback. But, it is some stupid 'super' cashback, which can't be redeemed as money. i don't see it being accepted in most services. The app gives an option as 'buy scratch card' for supercash. that too once in a month and only 10 points can be used. besides the supercash is having expiry. while other payment apps give direct cashback, this app fools us with some points. that's not cashback. u people should clearly mention as 'points' not cash."
Suresh Thota,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Jan-19,Very irritating app for money transfer annd bill payments. i given all my details Aadhar number and pancard number also but KYC not completed keep on asking update KYC. no customer care service to customers only recorded computer voice only coming whenever i call. this is literally cheating people. once you load money from your bank or credit card and if you want to pay or transfer money to bank then it will ask KYC. here you are struck that no chance to further step. my 10000 money struck as it
Madhusudan Sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-Dec-18,The supercash is a misrepresentation at best. The amount is not usable as cash rather through a complicated series of steps that just seems engineered to generate further transactions through the app and not something that's actually a viable system. Further the amount is not directly credited but is received via scratch card esque lottery.
Akhil Jeeson,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Jan-19,"this is the most irritating mobile payment app i have come across. I tried to update the KYC several time without wich i am not able to make any transaction (not even for the payment less than 10k). After entering my aadhar and otp, the app crashed. now i am not able to update it again as i am supposed to visit a near by KYCcenter and the nearest KYCcenter is around 700kms away. my money is stuck in this account and nothing can be done. I would recommend everyone to switch to other payment apps"
BhArAtH KaLlUrI's,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-Dec-18,I don't know why this mobikwik created. I think its waste of time to do payments or to do recharges also. It has given option boost from starting onwards I am trying to get loan which can support my finances now but when ever I tried it says sorry we are extending some thing like that it is coming. When I checked some YouTube videos regarding this they are saying need to do kyc. I done semi kyc for this when I activated this but to do full kyc I cannot find any mobikwik centres near here to me. I found an option that I can able to send my pan and aadhar self attested copy to a mail I'd and I did that also but I never get reply from them. I think they put these option for tumepass. customer support also very worst when I tried calling customer care it says we are doing rectification visit website or mobile app. when I go help section in app it says to report problem and it says 24 hours but the answer which I got is irrelevant when I am going to reply them ot says sorry wait 24 hours something like that. very worst customer services. I dont know why They had created mobikwik without no use.
Bereng Jamatia,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Oct-18,"Hey, I'm unable to upgrade into KYC account. When I tried to upload my Adhar card it shows, 'Sorry! This service is currently unavailable.' Now I'm unable to withdraw my Money to my bank account ! Very disappointed with this app. :-( The whole 9000 INR is stuck in this app. It's as too much for a student to loose."
deepak verma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Oct-18,"Can I get status on Ticket ID - 9565020 as on your website I'm unable to see any status in the Past issue section. Totally waste app. They'll show your transaction status as successful but its not being done on the merchant system. Also there is no option to contact to the customer service. No email ID, no phone number is there to contact mobikwik. You've just given the option to raise ticket in the help section on which you guys never replied. Also you've been fooling people with Supercash in which user can use only 5% of the amount. Worst app for doing payments. Free charge and paytm are far better than this. This is the reason you have no name or fame in the market."
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Mar-19,"Worst app. There is no cash back. It is in points and can use only 5% per transaction. In order to use this 100 points credited you have to make 20 multiple transactions. So to redeem 100 points you have to spend 1900 rupees from your pocket, ie approx 2000% of points you have earned."
Trived Shukla,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-18,"Once you add money in this app, you will not be able to transfer money to anybody from mobikwik wallet. If you try to pay your credit card , app you show you error that your credit card details are wrong..Most important they do not have on call customers service where your issue can be solved quickly. They respond on chat in 3-4 days and that also they will answer not related to question that was asked.. I lost 11000.. Please take care.."
Basavaraj Hiremath,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jan-19,Worst app I have ever seen 😠. We can't add our money back into our bank account. Please don't install this app. My money got stuck in the wallet. It's asking to complete KYC to transfer money back into account. But I m unable to complete KYC even I tried many times. It takes processing fee to transfer money to any bank account. i don't even want to rate 0.5 star for this.
Siddharth Sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Apr-19,"Garbage... no support at all.. 1. You have limitations on everything ie the transaction limit, person to perosn transaction limit, maximum amount limit, even worst is the OTP generation limit. It means if in any caseyou didnt receive OTP and you try to resend OTP, the app will say you have exceeded the maximum OPT limit. Even there is limit on Customer service, ie you can only raise a ticket and the team may contact you in 24 hrs. After that till 12 hrs you cant raise any tickets. Idiotic.."
varun khandelwal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-19,one of the most pathetic application i have used. i have been trying to transfer my money from your ridiculous wallet to my bank account but rather than transfering they have been asking me to file support ticket. It is because of your app i am in this problem because they are only trying to take money from their customer. It was my first day of using this app and that too because of my friend and now he is also regretting of using it. most pathetic experience.
Ninad Shaha,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-19,"Not able to pay any bill through App Since last few days I am not able to pay any bill through app. I get something went wrong message. But surprisingly through website I can pay all the bills. Not sure what's happening with App. I tried paying mobile bill, electricity bill, credit card bill was not able to pay any using app. Now say from Idea site I select option to pay using Mobikwick, then I do not get option to use super cash that is another bug I found."
Lakhvir Singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,08-Jul-19,"worst app. that's it. you won't get direct cash back with recharge, instead they give you in fractions. for example, you recharge your mobile for ₹500 and the full amount will be deducted from your bank account. what you get is ₹100 in wallet, and this amount can't be redeemed all together. They gave me ₹6 for this month, and to get 6₹ , I had to purchase scratch card for ₹10. in short, they are fraudsters."
Adarsh Bhachawat,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Jul-19,I have raised an issues since 48 hours. to delete my account because I no longer have access to thar number and unlink my KYC drom that number. I am not getting any responses from your end. In your application it is showing your query will be solved in 24 hours but it's already 48 hours and my query hasn't been solved. Pls do it as soon as possible.
Shaik Karim,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Feb-20,Superb but he was not giving loan
suhaas ram,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Oct-19,"This is the worst ever app i have seen. Any tickets raised they respond will be resolved in 24 hours, but its been 120 hours no response. And even when try to see the status, it often asks ""is your problem solved. Yes? Or No?"" Clicking no is like wait for some more time, but one thing to remember is other they are going to burn some time."
Jilani Shaik,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Jan-20,Really it's horrible and am gonna scrap this and will never gonna use this app in my life time bcoz I recharged with Rs. 30/- to this no.94****8234 & I got refund within 2 hrs but after that I did recharges to the same number with Rs.153/- but this time I didn't got any recharge to that number and I called BSNL operator they clearly said ua recharge was not successful and u will get refund bcoz they said that no. is not in active so suggest me to visit BSNL but in your app it's showing recharge
Pankaj Patil,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Jan-20,Bakwas app... Don't download it... This app give the supercash coins instead of cashback amount... This supercash didn't use in one time...

But when i lodged a complaint i did not get a feedback mail from their part. When I tried to call them it was just computer operated. Very very disappointed.. How can we trust these app.. I will move further at any cost.. This is not the way theh are supposed to be. Very very bad
Roger Frederick,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Apr-19,"If you make a fund transfer from your bank account to another bank account, they deduct from your bank account but instead of depositing to the other bank they keep the funds in your wallet and inform us to make input otp which they send on mobile. But unlike other banks they don't always send otp SMS. Now there is no way to withdraw your funds. You raise ticket in their app. They close the ticket. They don't have working phone. They don't reply to emails."
Manjeri Sadhashivan,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,08-Feb-19,"i find the concept of supercash paying parts of your bill very good and the app is smooth 99% of the time. however, i have noticed that sometimes it glitches/hangs and money gets deducted from the bank but takes several hours to show in the wallet. i have also noticed when booking rail tickets that even though the wallet balance is greater than the Amount required to be paid, mobikwik insists that i recharge the wallet with more money in order to complete the transaction, i dont understand why"
Debananda Choudhury,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Dec-18,"probably worst among all payment app. super cash is another trap to cheat customers. there is no meaning of geting a cash back in this app. this will have a limited validity and you will get very less chance to convert it into cash (once in a week, again the scratch card will finish far before the given time) such a cheater app..."

Chandra kant Sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Jan-19,i don't know what the maker's of this app think before making this app totally worst when the maker is unable to verify the customer through aadhar then y this option is provide in this silly app.always show captcha is wrong. using this app always a big Issue everytime a new problem is found. before making any app please be sure that all the functions in the app is working fine. and it should be user friendly instead of complicated.
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Mar-19,Very bad experience. If you are not allowing wallet transfer to another friend's wallet without FULL KYC then why you are allowing them to add money to wallet. Full of error and lag while updating KYC with Aadhaar.I tried 35 times yes 35 times. It always get failed with no specific error which leads me to get into trouble.I added 10K into wallet and I am unable to use that money neither transfer to friends Wallet nor in Bank account.Its really disgusting. Customer service is very pathetic.
Aeiou C,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Dec-18,Don't try to save your card details in this app. They were deducting money from cards without the users intervention... BE CAREFULLY It has been almost one month since I posted this comment here. Even now once in every week I am getting otp from my SBI card saying mobiquick is requesting XXX amount. This amount value varying every time I get an OTP. So guys please make sure what's happening in your Mobiquick account.
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Oct-18,"This is the most sickest app and company I have come across. User have to be very careful as you can't delete any information that is once linked with the app. If you write a mail to customer care, it is totally useless. The only option is to delete the account. Pathetic customer services. Telephone customer support - None picks the phone and automated recorded voice will keep on speaking to you even if you wish to hold for whole day. Mailing support - so much brilliant they are, that they would just paste the automated settings instructions in the app and paste in the mail. Finally, I would like to delete my account and have requested 2 weeks ago. Can some one from Mobikwik team address this."
Amazing Top 10,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jan-19,This is too bad App. Can't install it. can developer solve my problem. because I have 2000 supercash in my wallet but there is only one option in there to convert. but when I want to convert it the app always sow me sold is not live or another error. I think it is baddest app in the world. I think freerechage is best. because the app is directly convert my supercash to wallet money. but mobi quick isn't done this. can u help me.
Murali Krishna,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Mar-19,"Useless app and a kind of fraud business model. Cashback is given in the form of SuperCash which will expire after certain number of days. Even if you want to convert SuperCash to wallet cash, you need to buy scratch cards with ₹10(supercash)/each, again limited scratch cards per month. You're certainly going to lose your SuperCash as it expires soon. Instead use PayTm or PhonePe. If you still want to try, go ahead and lose your SuperCash. Cheers!!"

kumaran senthurpandian,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Aug-19,"It is good payment wallet. The payment of Mobikwik cash in other apps like Swiggy, medplus e.t.c., are really fast. Also loading cash into the wallet is lighting fast. My only issue is, you are demanding Adhaar or vendor verification to complete KYC. Vendor verification doesn't work and without completing this KYC, we are not allowed to use all the facilities provided by the wallet like transferring money to Individuals using their phone numbers, bank accounts e.t.c."
Jaseel M,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Sep-19,"I added cash in my mobikwik wallet.

When I tried for the customer care, they don't have a proper 24/7 customer care also. They work only from Monday to Saturday except other holidays that too with fixed timings. What do the company expect with such a limited time customer support for an app which is expected to work for people 24/7. Worst experience. Paytm's better."

Suman Pati,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Sep-18,Please don't use this app for any payment/ recharge.

In my case amt. Of 1344 rs deducted from my bank but payment not succeed till date I haven't received my money.
Nandkumar Deshmukh,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,12-Apr-19,"This is good app but if they can make few changes in it, it will become the best. Like in supercash conversion to wallet balance only one scratch card is allowed in month so the customer may loose his supercash as it has a validity of 3 months. Either there should not any limit of scratch card in month or you can allow him to convert higher amount to wallet balance so very little amount is lost due to expiry of validity."
Naja Mo Salah,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Dec-18,Worst ever platform found on play store and You are shameless earning your money from us. Why you are cutting money on a recharge and said sorry failed (just like crocodile crying) and making the money refunded onto your bloody wallet??? when we try to transfer that wallet money you charge a huge amount what the *uck?? Shameless company i rate in minus but it's unfortunate that 1 star for you this is even disappointed
Roy Sebastian,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,01-Feb-19,"Very poor experience compared to other apps. Some are like *KYC verification, *Extending transfer limits, *Transfering money from wallet to bank, *Main issue is draaaaaastic customer support, etc. I can't use many of your features with out any headache through your app. So I wish you could add my location also ie. Trivandrum, Kerala and it will be great that if you can inform me. Till then bye. Plus I'm adding, Paytm is the best(not a paid review)"
Manmath Bagali,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Feb-19,Amount gets deducted from my account but bill is not getting paid. This happens only when using some coupon code or supercash. It's processed smoothly if I'm paying the full amount without any offer applied. Same every time. Getting tired of this. Cant even raise a complain as the transaction is not even listed in the app. No details to contact them directly also. Overall a very bad experience. Would rate 0/5 if possible.
kunal jain,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,01-Mar-19,It is really a frustating app. They not even solve a single problem. I got deducted 1000rs through my UPI & while I was contacting mobikwik again & again they are just saying talk to your bank. The money already got deducted from the bank account. Ticket No. : 10549160. This app is really frustating.
Mohammed Zahid,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Oct-18,"I had a very bad experience from the beginning. Firstly i have recharged my wallet and tried booking train tickets. On the final stage, when i was supposed to make payment, the irctc app declined my transaction due to insufficient balance, were as i had enough balance for the payment. I treid several times, but the transaction was declined and as a result I couldn't book my ticket anymore and wasted precious time and effort. On the other hand i booked the train ticket through paytm hassle-free and speedy way. Then i requested the mobikwik customer to refund my money back to bank, it took around 10 days to resolve the issue after several email exchange. The second issue was same, i was trying to book ticket through irctc and the transaction was declined due to insufficient balance in mobikwik, were as i had enough balance in spite, the transaction was declined. When i requested the mobikwik customer to refund my money to bank back, they respond very very late and still its been 10 days, my money is in wallet struck up with no use and am waiting to get my money back. Why do you guys have customer service centre, why do u guys have tech team or any other when you cant solve a simple issue for about 10 days. I believe there is no issue in world would need 10 days to just process bank reversal, as you can do yourself in paytm. My humble request to all mobikwik user, please do not use the mobikwik wallet balance for booking irctc, resulting your money will get struck up, you will not be able to pay the ticket price, and finally you will loose time for booking ticket which will result the availability of ticket get lost. Dear mobikwik team, you guys have too many user, you guys can do better but pls concentrate on solving issues, we don't have any thing in our heart to give you less stars or bad comments, its our frustration because of your mistakes and lackness."
Nilesh Patel,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,01-Nov-18,"Hello, We can't transfer money till we upgrade our wallet in this app. And there is no kyc centre here in Ahmedabad..Now how can I upgrade my wallet? There is option of kyc upgradation by Aadhar card..this option is also showing message like ""currently this service is not available"" Then tell me how can I upgrade my wallet? Not user-friendly payment app at all. And they haven't provided any contact number details..so we are unable to contact them to solve our query"
viswa nathan,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,27-Feb-19,i used this app in another mobile phone using another mobile number and i have forgotten the security code. to unblocking the security code lot of pain taken still nothing happened to unblocking the security code. the issue goes past 15 days. nobody helps properly. i could not utilise my wallet amount for any transactions. just now i am sending again proof of aadhar card self attested asked them today (27.02.19)
Sushant Kanikdaley,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Apr-19,"I have been using this payment app for years now. First they introduced supercash which was good at beginning. Then they put restrictions. All supercash now simply expires. IT IS OF NO USE. The time came to uninstall the app when they denied to pay electricity bill by money added in wallet via credit card. Sorry, now you have failed as a good payment app."
Parag Sarwade,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Nov-18,This app is just ridiculous. I used it for electricity payment. Payment is debited from my account still it's not giving any confirmation for payment done. They are not giving any feedback on this. Bot generated replies which has been given to me and I think this is not appropriate . Please do not use this app for any transaction.
Jayakrishna M.G.,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Nov-18,Worst app ever. Stupid and idiotic concept called supercash and some scratch card system which never works when i try to buy one using supercash. I tried adding money to the wallet it failed. And there is no customer support team to contact to regarding this. Plus they have some system in which i cant file more than one complaint in 12 hours. ARE YOU GUYS FOR REAL. If i dont get back my money in the next 24 hours im gonna make sure all my friends unistall your app and never use it. I mean it for real. Dont make promises you cant keep.
Himanshu Gawri,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Aug-19,"Worst app in every aspect, help centre not responding from past one month, you can imagine how poor service they provide,problem in adding money through many cards,they even cheats customer by saying you can use 100% supercash on some particular date and time but I recommend to not do that, it's a trap, no supercash will be used and amount will get deducted through your balance only. My ticket ID - 11602701(pending from past one month)"
S. K.R,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Oct-19,Worst mobile wallet. Zero chance of getting customer support. Don't use this. Even raising a ticket or issue is not possible. After failed transaction money will be sent to wallet. There is no reversal of payment to your bank or card. You will be given only option is to use that money only through mobikwik wallet. Worst . Worst . Worst
Kiran Salunkhe,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Jan-20,Worst Experience.. They are showing in app that they will provide loan in 5 minutes.

Since my teansaction failed once, I again tried 2 times more and each time it wasn't completed and still my account got debited. So in all, against my single transaction, my account got debited thrice. I request you to look into the matter immediately since the amount involved is of substantial value."
uday babloo,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Apr-19,"worst service ever. I made a transaction last week which is wallet to bank transfer. Money deducted from wallet but not credited in my account.

I tried to contact on mails didn't got replay. Its been 7 days If I don't see my money in my account or wallet ill book a cheating case on MobiKwik."
Darshan Vishwakarma,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,10-Jan-19,The features are great compared to others but some important features should be faster. KYC update should be faster and instant with online verification. Should lot of more user friendly beneficial functions and services with instant verification and disbursal. With little more features and quick services this app will create a landmark in finance app category.
Jagadeesh Kalisetty,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Sep-18,Waste application i have ever seen. It doesnot even work properly. From my account amount was debited while transferring but not credited to other account and when I ask them in help section they said ask you source bank. When I ask the person in bank they said ask MobiKwik . Then finally my money was gone. Please go with other application Don't try MobiKwik.
Gopinath Ramachandran,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-May-19,"I am a registered user. I use to transfer many times a month using MobiKwik wallet. Till last month I had wallet balance limit upto 100000 per month but the app is not allowing me to add money stating, you have reached the monthly limit. I am sure that I have not reached the monthly limit, added only 6000 to my wallet this month. This is an error from your side and I am raising tickets for the past two weeks you are closing the tickets without resolving the issue. Not picking up phone calls too."

G.MAJUMDER 9435009664,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Oct-18,"Very very bad app. Cash back in the form of ""super cash""which you can't use as per your need. A very small percentage you can use as permissible by movikwik! Support partners are very bad..e.g. I booked OLA cab as per advertisement on this app home page making payment from my mobikwik wallet after adding money to it from my bank a/c using debit card (though I have sufficient supercash as cash back, but mobikwik don't allow to use it ) before riding. But the cab driver didn't accept that payment and dropped me midway on my trip. So disgusting!!!"
Padmini Rao,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,08-Aug-19,"Worst app. supercash is just humbug as you cannot use it all at once. Also with use by date, after which it lapses. Transfer to bank is another fraudulant feature. It never is successful even if you forego some amount called as ""transaction charges"". Finally used the balance to pay a merchant and un-installed the third rate app."
Arun Dev,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Nov-19,I've used this application for past couple of years and never faced this much transaction failures til recently. Every single Tatkal booking in irctc is failed (last 6 streak) due to transaction failure from wallet or failure to receive otp. Never depend on this app for critical transactions. Its a complete failure now and their customer service is the worst. Treats customers like ****.

bhargav gopalkrishna,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Feb-20,Mobikwik and DMI are running a biggest scam of insta loan together. Every month auto debit will happen on next day of due date(scam) this is to collect penalty. This time i paid emi using mobikwik app itself but even then Autodebit has taken place from my account next day. Both have the most ridiculous customer care services to which you cannot reach anytime. Anyway i have taken this to consumers forum. I will definitely sue them for misuse of NACH mandate. A fraudulent company.
Shyam Sirohi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Feb-20,The app service is very poor. I complained about my money debited from Mobikwik wallet but not reaching IRCTC. But even after lapse of more than 36 hrs the issue was not resolved and no one from Mobikwik contacted me. Very poor service.

Other than all app it not gives cashback as wallet balance but gives as supercash which we cant use as required but only 5% of transaction money can be use from supercash at a time. So dont download it. Very useless and wrost app."
Collin Davis,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-Dec-18,"This is by far the worst app compared to the players in the market. And this ""Supercash"" thing is among the most stupid concepts ever. Make no mistake about it. You rather not give discounts than introducing this moronic supercash. To give you some background, I transacted close to 5.5k on Netmeds with Mobikwik where it was clearly stated you will get cashback of Rs 200 and not Supercash. When I made the transaction though, I received cashback in Supercash which you can use only 5% on every transaction. I cancelled the order and had about 5.5k in my mobikwik account. When I tried transferring it to the bank, they asked for a convenience fee of Rs 178. Its a joke. You don't give 1% interest on my Mobikwik balance but charge me a ridiculous convenience fee. Now I am forced to spend on Mobikwik because I need to use my balance. Among all mobile wallets, mobiwik is the shittiest. Period!"
susanta sahoo,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Apr-19,"the worst app ever. Google should remove this from play store. two incidents with me- 1. debited my food wallet money without any notification and not giving any invoice for that transaction as well. 2. two times irctc ticket bookings failed due to issue from mobikwik side. so i booked tickets from other sites. now when transfer back my money from mobikwik wallet they charged me. they wasted my time, money worst customer care there, they will never pick up your call ."
A Google user,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,25-Mar-19,One of the best ewallet and payment apps... But one can able to covert the supercash into cash only one time in one whole month... I think it should have more than one times to redeem the supercash coupon limit option in a month... Also one thing is that there is no direct option to book rail tickets within the app... Without these it is a food app...
Amartya Bose,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Oct-18,"I have been using Mobikwik for more than 2 years. Initially it was quite good. Money deducted from bank and not updated on Mobikwik was a common issue. Usually they refunded by 2 days. But alas times have changed. On September 30th, I lost Rs 4760 due to this issue. Now they have closed off all customer service number and email addresses, except the help portal in the app. Even if I raise a ticket there, nothing is actually saved, and not a single reply is received thereafter. We have options like Paytm, Freecharge, PhonePe etc. They might not give out tons of fake Supercash, but at least they don't steal like you do. Refund my Rs 4760, or else I will keep on posting on each of your Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter pages , exposing the thieving company you really are.To divert attention they will send a message by the feedback team ( like Vibhor Thakur below) but on replying to the feedback team, nothing actually happens. After 15 days its supposed to refund the amount. It did not happen. And now they are playing, complete your full kyc first. Still no reply on when they will send the team for kyc completion."

Sazid Mansoori,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,20-Jun-19,it is a good app but not as much as I was thinking. there is a problem with this app some time you are not able to add and transfer the amount. some time it shows you exceed your limit or exceed your OTP limit etc that's why you are not able to add and transfer the amount. there is a suggestion please increase your limits no one can transfer more than 10000 rupees in one time lots of thing like that so please work on it ASAP. while customers are being charged still facing problem not fare. thank
Swastika Das,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Sep-19,This is the worst app I have ever used. They have fake mobikwik agents. The app is vicious.

Apurva Paliwal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-19,"worst app. dont install, they are adding money and not allowing you to use it to pay for any utilities. you will never be able to use supercash its just a trap. money gone to the wallet cannot be used and error shows something went wrong try again later. this error is showing since past more than one month. dont dont use. customer care is worst. noone will resolve. zero rating"
Sushant Julka,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Mar-19,"There's no option not to choose any star, though I would have to give single star somehow. Please don't use this app, one of the worst and useless app I ever installed. If you guys are using just uninstall it right away. @ Mobikwik- You can check my conversation which I had with your stupid, cheap employees for more details."
A Google user,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,08-Apr-19,"app is good. But worst thing is you do not have phone support. So less transperency is there if any issue occurs in future. One more thing is that you are charging 3.75 % fee which I feel like old age 'sahukars'. This is not justifiable. If you r charging this for imps, you also should give option like normal money transfer which may take a day - which can be understood. or any other option."
Sitakanta Pradhan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Oct-18,"This app just shows fake ads on cashbacks. They just post it on their app show a date but they dont give any cashback. And the main drawback of this app is they dont have any problem resolution method, not a customer service number. The solve problem on their own just write on the app solved without any solution."
Rajesh Kumar,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,21-Feb-20,Good app. Not all the times but sometimes brings good offers. They need to improve and must remove supercash and bring cashback.
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,31-Jan-19,"the biggest problem in mobikik app is giving super cash instead of giving cash back that means you are bound to do the transaction for ever with Mobikiki. second issue ,they are charging 2.8 % when we transfer money from walet to bank that is too much as compare to other apps. Even if we use virtual card transactions ,they are charing more where other apps like Yes bank bhim app , payzap,tmw , airtel money never charged a single money from customer for virtual card transactions."
anudeep karkera,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Dec-18,"This is one of worst app, it had shown a cash back for recharge of Jio 399 ,and after you recharge , to get the cash back we have to redeem it through a cash back scratch card , where as the scarch card always shows exhausted, you get fooled . Don't download this app . Its terms and conditions are a complete nonsense."
Karan Bansal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Sep-18,"it is a stupid app. every app pay proper cashback which we can easily use without any limitations but MOBIKWIK SUPERCASH is useless and we can say it is a web for the customer. scratch card system is also very bad . no one can use even 10% amount of supercash. no proper care of customer available. 15 days ago i submitted my friend who is a shpkeeper , apply for merchant account but there is no any reply and no any mail in the reply. so don't download it , very stupid app"
Bhatruhari Bhuyan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Dec-18,"This is a good payment's application but this lacks the smooth performance as given by its other competitors in the market. Also it doesn't give any cashbacks while joining from any links and the system of adding cards and redeeming them to get cashbacks is a lot confusing. While the apps like phonepe or Google pay are easy and light and are very fast too, this app isn't that much smooth in its performance and is a bit clingy"
Saptadeep Bhattacharjee,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Sep-18,"Very bad app... app performance is good;but mobikwik's policies /rules with payments will make users mad especially the SUPERCASH issue. On every (most of the transactions) you will get cashback i. e;the SUPERCASH which is of no use. You can't even use it properly...at max. can be used up to 5% still depends on merchants... in many cases can't be used You will get 1000 rupees as Supercash but ONLY 5 to10 RUPEES CAN BE REDEEMED... other amount will remain in your wallet & get expired. Very poor policy by mobikwik taken. The wallet, poor cashbacks & the SUPERCASH stresses the users brain constantly and will surely cause serious MENTAL HEALTH HAZZARDS. I would request every one not to use it. The SUPERCASH's balance and wallet balance will continously affect YOUR BRAIN and will affect one's performance. Other payment portals are more better. For users sake, if you are a LAKHPATI, then only use this app....... ; on that case transact [5% of 100000] =5000 SUPERCASH can be used😁😁 Thank you"
Pradeep Singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Apr-19,"Don't install , it's a trap. You will not get cashback instead you will be getting supercash(kind of mobiwik money) but the catch is that you can't use the full cashback amount at the time of another transaction. suppose you got 500 cashback but if you are recharging your mobile you can use just 30 40 rupees from that cashback not the full amount. Untill or unless you have a mobile recharge booth etc you couldn't use that beacuse cashback expores in 3 month...🙏"
Deepak Soni,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,31-Mar-19,"Worst app ever. wastage of time and harden money. it just make sure you do not use any other app.you get stuck in this app. u cant transfer ur money back to ur account. it always show some error during transactions and suddenly all amount will debited from account and add in this wallet. then u cant transfer ur money back to ur account. m just fed up that why I used this. loyalty cash, super cash, wallet etc there are many more things to stuvk ur cash into this wallet.it shouldn't b on playstore"
Sheeraz Shabbir,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-Dec-18,Since a year my pin is blocked. App instruct to submit documents- but where? No option for such. Also the developer didn't have any customer care service on call so that get idea by calling the same. Thats why most of the payment wether to make railway ticketing or other transactions now I started doing through Google pay and Paytm
c. karunakaran,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Jan-19,I had used this app to transfer money from my credit card...last month I added money to transfer bank account..Mobikwik blocked my account I dont know what happened to my wallet..then I sent mail to mobikwik company with id proof and card statement scanned copy with attestation..this processing continuing 40 days I sentupto 20 mail .but money₹ 16000 isn't returned to my account.. my questions 1)why will allow money to add without any proof to this wallet? 2) I did already added my adhar no
The GrEgOrY,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Oct-18,"The worst wallet I ever used. I have been using this wallet for about 2 years. When I add 500 last day on 2nd October2018. Its been debited from my account and not credited to wallet. When i raise a ticket , they are stating that it was taken for wrong transaction I done 2 years ago. And not even responding to the tickets properly. The worst experience."
Rajesh Rakshe,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-May-19,Worst app ever for payments...!! I tried adding 4200/- amount to wallet and it failed first time when using UPI. I tried second time and txn was successful. then I got two notification of 4200/- got added. so total 8400 got added to wallet which i never wanted. I tried to reverse that extra 4200/- money to bank but then app was charging around 200 Rs. I am so angree after looking this on my first ever use of app.. I wish this gets resolved and I get my money reversed without extra charge.
Aryan Singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,01-Nov-19,My account has been disabled since last 20 days. It has an wallet balance of 41608 but then also I am not able to use it. I wrote around 3 to 4 mails to your team but not got an single response from your side. You call is not also been connected. For that purpose only I am giving 1 star. Resolve my issue than I am going to give 5 stars.
Himanshu Gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Nov-19,Not at all reliable. You pay your bill and forget your money. After few days you will get to know that bills are not paid and late payment charges are applied. You raised a complain over the app and they just refund your bill amount and close the ticket. They do not care for your late payment charge. They even do not acknowledge you that your payment was not made to merchant and they are refunding it back till time you do raise a concern and keep your money to them.
Pratik Revankar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Dec-19,"Worst experience & less likely to use it. Recharge says successful but it doesn't reflect on my account. Also, the need help section is helpless,it shows we'll look into the transaction but no updates yet. Wallet amount is untransferable to bank without KYC, if you can add money without KYC then why can't you add it back then without KYC? I would like to have a explanation for that. Won't recommend it, also soon to be uninstalled once I get my refund for the recharge."
Aliasgar Kapadia,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Jan-20,Why my account has been disabled. You guys are not answering the call on customer care than why you have given the number.

Into your cash wallet...once a month...and the expiry date of cashback cutting is only 3 months...it means u can use of 30 rs. Of your cashback..and the other money...cut by the mobikwik
Amarjit Gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-May-19,useless app....always money transfer gets pending and returns after a week.....today it seems to be in big bug....i transferred money at sometime and history shows 10 minutes slower timestamp for transaction.... everywhere in app show three types of history ...again my transfer issue again occurred i transferred it shows successful but no money is transferred.....and most important useless support team no call helpline......abhi bhi nahi sudhra
jaison jacob,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Sep-19,This app is very bad for cash payments. I was recharged Rs 399 to my vodafone connection. Cash deducted from my bank account but the recharge not done. Complaint raised with mobikwik (ticket-12162737) resolution is that I should go to vodafone office and collect a written confirmation. And share to mobikwik for my money. How mobikwik can say recharge is succesful? My mobile is not yet recharged. Call vodafone care 198 for the confirmation if have any doubt. That should be appreciated.
Sujan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Dec-18,I have asked support to fix an issue last month. Still the issue persists..I am unable to use super cash while making insurance payment. It gets applied but when I click make payment it is not progressing... meanwhile most of my super cash expired...this app wastes my time...don't you guys have some responsibility?
vishal parmar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Jan-19,"The reason for me clicking not sure is that now I can add money but cant spend it on any thing, may I know the reason?

I have added money to the wallet in order to pay that to someone though it got added but not able to transfer it to the person if kyc is required to make any transaction then why app allowed me to add money into it... Now my money is stuck in the app neither I be able to move back it to my account nor able to pay it to anyone.... Trying to call customer care from yesterday but no response..... Paytm is best....

shekhar utkarsh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Dec-18,Added certain amount to make a transaction and then I was not allowed to complete the transaction saying that KYC is not completed. I was not even allowed to do the KYC as their in app KYC request doesnt work any more. They will allow you to add money to the wallet but then they will start fooling you around in the name of KYC. Seems to be a big legit Scam. Paytm is way better than this.
Satish Kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,08-Mar-19,Very worst experience with this app especially with customer support here I can say that this app has the least possible or we can call it as nill customer support team. From the past 1 week around 50k has been blocked due to this app but there is no response or service for this mistake and on the other way they are saying that transaction is successful. They are not even bothering about customers.
Milan Jade,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Apr-19,"its a worst app, dont transfer any money to this app, it asks for KYC thru Adhar, and u will get tired of reading some thing went wrong, you try to contact thru chat, it will say invalid ticket, it simply retain your money for their benefits, you try to recharge mobile, electricity bill, or DTH you will get only one answer, something went wrong"
Adarsh Yadav,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Dec-18,"Worst app in Mobile wallet category. To transfer money into bank account or wallet or even to pay to merchant, KYC is madator(according to the government laws), but the update KYC section i s alway ""out of service"" it's very annoying.Also I have faced a remarkable number of issues in getting back the refund amounts over last 4 months."
Nigel Pinto,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-May-19,"pathetic process to upgrade the wallet via adhar card. Keeps giving an invalid captcha error. why is the uidai site disabled in the background? why are you continuously refreshing the captcha text? because of it the error is thrown! can you just allow the app to direct the user to the uidai site to get the details verified, instead of the popup window in the app?"
Pradeep kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Dec-18,one of the big stupid wallet app once the money is added to this account u cannot return back any ways not sure how RBI encourages such things holding money of a user hope they will resolve such issues by fixing those issues... 1 adding money will fail some times deducting the same from bank 2 the failed transaction will add the money lil later in to balance 3 this balance we cannot return back to bank or any other payment using balance alone cause of mobikiwik issue user has to face the lose
Chidambaram M,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,15-May-19,"The application is very smooth. It is well developed. The only problem is the limit on number of OTPs. If a transaction does not gets through in a couple of attempts, you may have to wait for a long time to get new OTP. I know OTP is not free but the waiting time should only be few minutes."
Chandankumar Biswal,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,31-May-19,I don't think that it's a usefull app for instant lone ... whenever I try to get instant lone it shows me that currently unavailable... we are working hard on this topic etc.. im irritating.. if someone needs money instantly then he can't able to get it on this app.... @mobikwik if you are showing that get instant 60 thousand lone in some time then why I can't able to get it... I'm disappointed really
Prakash Krishnamurthy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,30-Jun-19,"Poor wallet, I recharged my wallet, but could not pay from the wallet. Only shows option to pay from bank account or credit card. Too bad. Super cash is also very tricky not much could be done with thousands of Supercash. Earning of Super cash is much easier, can't spend it. Transferring back to bank account invites lot of financial charges again. Fuel recharge applicable only on selected pumps, not in my commuting route atleast. Overall very disappointed with the wallet app."
rahul agnihotri,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Jul-19,"I have taken loan from this app, after 6 month my 1 emi delayed, thats why they pulled my contacts details from my phone, and started calling to my contacts and one their executive said to my contacts that they have to pay for loan otherwise they will be considered as defaulter. when i talked to their executive she was very rude to me and she tried to mentally harass me."
Dipesh Singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jul-19,"i am not able to update my primary no. i contacted many times for support they did not even try to help me. when i change the primary no, with a another no. it shows that your no is new no is disabled. i linked all bank account to the new no. so i am not able to use upi or add money. same problem is solved within two days in paytm. i hope you my problem is solved by MobiKwik. i am still waiting."
GOPAL SRI VAISHNAVA,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Jan-20,"Worst app, this app cheating to the customers.

NagaPrasad,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Oct-18,Please don't install this app for buss booking. Bus prices are very high with compared to other apps.

P MP,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Oct-18,The app is not good in case you have any issues with respect to your transactions. The app is not secured and protected properly as I had an authorised transaction and there was no help provided by the Mobikwik customer care team. There is no customer care contact number and all issues are resolved only through mails which takes months long to answer the queries forget about resolving the issue. Pls think before you install this app.
subhASH chowdary,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Nov-18,"Super cash is a waste concept. The amount you get can't be used. It can only be used in smaller proportions.

Mr Vishal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Feb-19,Most ridiculous app over playstore.. it hapend more then twice that i recharged and recharge wasnt successful but money was deducted from my bank account. and then as per their refund policy it takes 21days to refund the money. may be it is their trick to fool customers assuming customer would let go the money or wont keep any hopes of refund. its been 10days and i am still waiting for them to refund amnt of Rs1038/- even after writing them more then 10times. #Bloody Frauds.
R.S RAVI,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Apr-19,Mobikwik app Trust me it's a very worst app . It will refunded you back in 20 to 31 days if you cancelled you transaction payment Amount in future. It will be only a lollipop in the name of supper cash. There is no customer helpline Support in this app only message help desk wich response after 24 hour of your issue registered .My experience was bad and totally disappointed with the work of Mobikwik.

navin bhaskar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Nov-18,Just useless as there is worst support system and resolution centre. They do not have proper book entry for cash and super cash.

Anand,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,06-Jan-19,"Not good as expected I used many paying apps, this mobikwik app doesn't pay quick I faces lots of troubles and super cash back 😃😃 discusting idea only for mind diversion. Your cash back is like myntra points you never use 100%. Only 10 % or below you use. In my opinion go for paytm, Amazon pay or airtel pay bank."

It also asks for Aadhaar number for verification. This is yet another useless app. Linking your bank account is dangerous and must be avoided at all costs."
rimi roy,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Dec-18,wow!its an amazing experience of getting transaction done from mobiquick app.I just entered the amount of my mobile bill and it proceeded with the transaction without any further verification.I think this might be the fastest way to pay your bills on time so that you can pay your bills in the deadline period.
Madhurima Chowdhury,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-19,"Though I have never installed this app, but still I get text messages of OTP of login and even mails of otp that someone is trying to login from new browser.This is hapenning for past 2-3 months.

Mohammed Faseeullah,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Nov-19,Cheating app and misleading information. This aap promots to get Super cash on various bill payments. Which can not be used at once. Only some portion which there is no explanation in there Q&A can be used. Its like from 100 rupees of your super cash only 5 rupees can be used for a single bill payment. They r going cheep on us. There is a converter of super cash if u have for example 200 SC u get 6 cash from 10 rs token.
Rahul Kumar Gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-19,Worst app for upi transfer . It always seems an error to send money . I complained this for 1 month ago . Yet now there is no solution and no reply from mobikwik customer support . And also they will reply here very fast for showing they give faster response but on app they didn't help . Don't try this app instead you can try paytm app
Hasan Jilani,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Aug-19,"The most important thing while using any recharge app is to get cashback, but here we are getting supercash, which is actually a trash. We can only use 5% of the transaction amount which is a joke, I got a 200 supercash on my first transaction n then I can only use 1.75 on my next recharge of 35. I will definitely uninstall this app, as its of no use, every other app gives cashback which we use anywhere."

Shubham Gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Oct-18,Very bad app. Worst experience. Very pathetic idea of SuperCash. This idea is keeping behind to compete with other wallets like Paytm and FreeCharge. Users must have option to spend SuperCash with out any restriction. Atleast give users option to transfer SuperCash to Bank Account with Nominal Charges as Paytm does. Paytm is better than this. Mobikwik hides Important Information. This will decline your Customers.
RaTHORe Akashh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Nov-18,One of the worst App ever. Every time you need to try multiple times to make payment and once the transaction get failed you need to wait for long to get the debited amount back to your A/c. Pathetic. Technology is to make our life easier but this app always gives you headache.

I don't know what to do? Totally waste don't install mobikwik app....
hemender singh,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,13-Oct-18,"The biggest drawback of your application is there is no customer care number so where someone would contact mobi please provide the number, and please don't make people fool by telling super cash in your wallet cause how someone could use it.

Chandresh Shakywar,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,14-Oct-18,It is so good but cashback is in form of supercash and coupen can be avail on Sunday only at 7:00pm I don't think it's so good if money is mine than it depends on me when I will use it or when I want to convert it in cash. This app is good and offers are so good only the type of supercash is not so good.
Vinod Nair,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,21-Mar-19,"App is good but the customer service / redressal mechanism is horrible and cumbersome.

And also there is no proper customer care help to inform the issue. Very worst app and so planning to complaint in consumer court. The proof of evidence is the message from HDFC Bank about the money deduction by Mobikwik app."
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Oct-18,"It is a pathetic app. The cheapness of the makers of this app reflects in the offers. They call it cash back but you cannot use your cash back directly. NO..you have to do it as per their rules and regulations. Stupid makers. They are allowing only to use 5% of so called supercash to be used. So that we load more and more balance in this app. Seriously...you are so cheap man. Whoever is the maker of this app, he must be the cheapest man alive.Ome suggestion, think big, have a big heart....or else you will see this app going down very soon. Change your policy, make it more comfortable for customers, don't harrass them. And clearify the term and conditions initially. We are not fools and if you think so then you will come to know who is a real fool very soon."

But irony is you you'd be able to pay online so that rhe transaction can be done through Wallet and their so called Mobikwik wallet will in use. Really hate this app and management as well. I mean how anyone can be so cozy never thought of their Customer. just for own benefit... Fuc**** Mobikwik wallet. Don't use it. it's Kind request it's trap nothing else!!
Arminius Arminius,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jul-19,Primary focus of this app is to cheat people with supercash.A digital currency which has very limited scope of using.And it also comes with a expiry date.So that the cash back you actually earn is expired before you can use it.If you are really looking for good offers don't download this app. Moreover the help centre doesnot give satisfactory answer.I have made a complaint and the issue is not resolved for 15 days.God knows when it will answer. Moreover the upi transaction get failed frequently.
Amandeep Singh,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Dec-19,"Excellent application. The user can store receive,send and spend money. The user can recharge phone numbers,dth connections,make electricity payment,book a taxi etc. There is much more available in this application. Also, the transactions and refunds are very quick. Supercash received by the users can not be used completely and it gets expired if not used within expiration period. Cashbacks are a better option as it do not get expired and the whole amount can be used at once also."
Karam Jaspal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Aug-19,Your app and way you offer discounts or cashback is super crazy. You guys mention ₹blah blah cashback on various apps. But the cashback redemption is super fictitious and crazy experience for a customer with time limits to redeem here and there. Other apps are way simpler and no catch at all. Not coming back to your app and going to uninstall it.
Akhilesh Kura,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Aug-19,"This is the worst app i have never seen, I have 6200 bugs in my wallet and my account is not supporting to transfer this to any bank account because of KYC not done. I have reached many KYC centers to make it happen and none of them have helped me with KYC. Thought of using this at least for paying the credit card bill, even that's not happening. If there is any possibility to give negative rating instead of 1 I would have done that. I hope atleast someone will respond to me."
Srinivasa Ramanujam,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,20-Sep-19,"MaxGetMore is disabled! The one think I liked most with MobiKwik is redeeming MaxGetMore points. But it seems Mobikwik has disabled this permanently. I have been trying for the past few months, but it does not work. I am no longer able to redeem my maxgetmore points. Other than this, I don't like their supercash model. Already mobikwik gives less reward in the form of cashback, and this too is added as supercash. On top of it, they say that we cannot utilize more than 10% supercash for any transaction. so effective cash back is less than 1% most of the time. With this strategy, they are bound to lose more customers to competitors who are providing attractive cashbacks, some of them even deposit the cashback directly in our bank accounts. For mobikwik to remain competitive, they have to change their policy. otherwise, they wont exist in long term."
Deepayan Dey,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Oct-19,"My experience for the last two month is worst,I cannot recharge from this app, always giving error that first log in than recharge,while I already logged in,now today when I try logged out for log in again,the OTP not accepted by application,my wallet amount now not using by me, response urgently and give solution."

I know how to apply coupon btw and u guys have just disappointed me for behaving unprofessionally.
Saurabh Srivastava,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Dec-18,"App has worst plateform, its working worst, its supercash logic is worthless. You can not use supercash where even you are eligible some kind of technical glitch but mobikwik does not recognises even after a lot of complaints. Unsual charges deduction on payment at irctc where clearly mentioned charges are nil for debit cards. On complaining firstly mobikwik said it is lg charges. When i saud it should be nil as disclosed on payment page (by submitting screenshot) then they said it may be charged by your bank (which are deducted separately in my bank). Other wallets are much better that has sure cashback in main wallets. This is a loot."

If you care, call me to resolve this."
Anuj Garg,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-May-19,"It's worst app ever Since there is no option of zero stars otherwise i would give that. Supercash is just a way of cheat users. Lot restrictions on every thing like utilization of supercash they said u can use 5% of transaction value but there also a small limit on that, expiry period is so small, u can't use supercash on credit card payments, Some of the reasons I download the app but later delete it immediately Bcoz of such worst terms and conditions. It's a worst payment app I have ever use."

You can use only 5% of transaction amount as SuperCash at any time. Moreover, your previously earned SuperCash is not used up if you're getting any SuperCash on a transaction. All this implies your SuperCash can get expired without even getting used in many situations."

SHUBHAM JHALAWA,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,02-Jan-20,Hey Guys why you're disabled card radeem point function. It was great but not now. Please update and enable the function.
s. s,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jan-20,Worst payment app ever. They give you supercash which is of no use. You can not convert it into cash due to limitations it's like they convert the money into something unusable.
Rohan Kharate,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jan-20,Poor experience. You keep getting random ito sms of login and then of transaction even when you dont have the app installed. Absolute waste of time

After many attempts I have to recharge with 99 which was only for jio phone. After that I have lost my ₹99 because of MobiKwik. Disgusting job. Hide quoted text"
A Google user,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Dec-18,You can not spend Super cashe fully bcz only 5% super cash can be used. That yoo not in all transactions. Also your super cash validity is only 2-3 months. Cash back is different and super cash is different. Other apps give cash backs which can be used any time and any amount. This app is dumb.
Varsh Patel,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Sep-18,"Worst application i have ever used.. My security pin got blocked and they asked me to upload documents to unblock, i have uoloaded all the required documents but still they didn't unblock my pin.

king singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jan-19,Worst experience. I was regular user and they have bugs in app. I booked bus ticket but message about seat details not sent and amount deducted. Then they sent message regarding ticket after one week saying it was confirmed. Worst customer care support. Go for other wallet apps as it has bugs which they don't fix.
pratap mansingh,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,15-Dec-18,This app is working not bad but after recharge it's takes more time. So fix these issues and required some changes this aap software now to quickly saucesfull recharges. If you solve this problem then consumers are not suffering from delay recharge again. Thank you very much.
rahul raj khanna,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,14-Feb-19,Initially your offers were good slowly slowly i used your offers seems cheating to customer. i wish saying than stealing cash app should be name of your app. who steal a money. app is good but the policy of cash back is worst. cash is not been used as and when required. you give cash back and steal away same. you are like a fake company not interested in giving a cash back. i wish i can stop using the same. i hope one day god give you wisdom to be true and stop cheatimg and stealing money.
Sourabh Mokashi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-May-19,"I entered the correct PIN multiple times. The app still showed that I had entered wrong PIN. I can't go ahead with any transaction because of this. I want my money back that the Mobikwik wallet has, else I will complain about this somewhere else. It's not my mistake, it's a mistake at your end."
tinku roy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Apr-19,worst app I had using this app from a long time so I stop using the number which is registered in mobikwik. after log out I found that there is no account recovery from email. it's only from mobile number otp.

Piyush Prateek,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Sep-18,"It is giving supercash but it is not allowing to use that supercash. I tried to pay my electricity bill so many times but it is showing ""something went wrong, please try later"". Then I tried to pay electricity bill of my friend of different state. There it is showing ""bill not found"" This is worst app I have found till now. Paytm phonepe, airtel and other apps are far better than this app. I can't even compare this app with paytm, phonepe and other apps."
suneel tiwari,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Mar-19,"since 2019 app is not working properly. I want to send my query it shown repeat ticket within 12 hour is not allowed., also I am unable to pay my electric bills. I am unable to reach customer support team. very bad experience."

Keval Raj,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Jan-19,Please do not install. Not trustable. You take my PAN card details while transferring money from wallet to bank? After giving PAN details you did not allow transfer until and unless I provide my aadhar details. Why the hell do you need aadhar details to complete the transaction. Without aadhar details you are not allowing to do money transfer.. This is mere illegal. You provide a acceptance checkbox where illiterates will just provide aadhar details. Such a illegal activity is not acceptable
A.Surendra Manjunathan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-May-19,"Very Worst App, tried to book train ticket using Mobiwik wallet and it took long time to open the app, was using high speed wifi in my home, even the irctc app opened very fast in tatkal booking time, but it took long time to open Mobiwik app and the amount got deducted and booking was failed, such pathetic app, will never again use mobiwik wallet to book train tickets."
Sumit Namdev,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Jun-19,worst app ever. Don't Install. They let You add money But You can't Use it for any facility like billpay or recharge. Every time when I tried to pay My bill or recharge my no. They show Error message 'something went wrong'. Don' Install this. zero rating for you.
Nitin Suri,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Jul-19,"It's such a useless application when compared with PayTM etc. They generate a virtual cash called as Supercash but you won't find any area to use it You can't connect to the customer care via phone or mails as emails to them always bounce. They call you for an issue but never follow it up, hence your problems will never get resolved."
Vijay Surve,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Jul-19,you know what... you guys are doing fantastic job for recharge compare to other wallet. the process for recharge is pretty simple and I never get the error while processing it...

Paras Dadlani,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Nov-19,"The worst app ever, fake promises through advertisement & playing the bitter game technicality/rules. The UI also is made in such a way that you will not even if promo code is applied. Such apps should not even exist. I get all the bad vibes thinking of name of the app itself. Worst, worst worst."
Shanmugam P,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Jan-20,"Worst - Fraud App - please do not download..once you add balance to wallet then user will be disabled immediately..then you loose your hard earned money.. No customer care number, if you email you will not get any response from them."

For recharging the wallet they want Pan Card detail but when it comes to transfering that money to bank account they need KYC. Even I tried to complete the KYC but te app tells me that ""something went bad"".

Saikat Jasu,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-May-19,3rd class payment app. 1. You can transfer money from bank acc(linked upi acc)to wallet free of cost but to withdraw money from wallet to bank you have to give >3% money and GST(which are not taken in phone pay app). 2. Marchent payment is the worst among all it always deduct money before the successful payment if payment is not successful you have to wait 24h to get your money back and it dont have voice call customer support to complain. 3. Offer on this app is low compare to other app.
Raghuvar Jha,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Oct-18,It's such a waste app to make payments as if you do any transaction and received suoercash and for redeeming it you have to wait for a week i.e on sunday at 7'0 clock and at that time if you scratch something went wrong..its just a waste of time...betrer to use some other payment method as you can use that wallet balance immediately dont have to wait for months....its a waste of money to using this app

Balkrishna Kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Jan-19,Worst Experience I have had my worst experience of online recharge on this app. I had done my first recharge and i faced the same problem that fraudsters use to cheat people. Amount deducted but recharge not done and no acknowlegement of failed transaction had been provided. So guys be careful and if u use plz dont do any heavy transaction on this app.
Dinesh Pawar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Nov-18,This is a fraud app. It gives super cash which cannot be usable directly as other payment apps. Mobikwik charges huge transaction charges. In short other apps gives us huge discounts on the spot with transparency. On the other hand mobikwik pretends to give us useless super cash to loot us in every transaction. This is a worst & fraud app. Mobikwik didn't give me anything in real but looted me for transaction charges. I had to pay more than original amount.

sagar suman,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Dec-18,Allows UPI transfer without verifying my device. I changed my mobile set.downloaded it and it allowed me to transfer money through UPI without verifying my handset. It's totally unsafe then. uPi has two layers of protection one is device and second it PIn . And you have given hackers an easy way to get through one of it. Kudos. The most untrustworthy app
A Google user,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,28-Nov-18,"The app is also a featureful but lots of problem found in like adhaar register,super cash convert etc & many more.Help option is making fool us & not help by customer specialist .I am not able to register my adhaar number & not upgrade my wallet.i tell my problem to service specialist but no solution.this is totally fake features & if I helped by Service specialist to help in my account quickly then I update my comments on Google Play.."
Majumder Services,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,30-Jun-19,I am a regular user of mobikwik from last two years.. The app is good. But I am highly disappointed with the BOOST CREDIT service of mobikwik. I failed to get credit every time I proceed. It shows that mobikwik is unable to give me credit this time. I don't know the reason but my credit score is enough to get loan.. This is very disappointing..

vasanth chennai,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Jul-19,"Super cash is of no worth. Other apps like amazon, phonepe gives instant cash back added to wallet but here its in the name of supercash which if we reedem it charges 10 supercash and gives a scratch card and the amount is added to the wallet and only one scratch card may be availed per month. And there is a limited validity period of 3 months. Example if we have a supercash of 200 i can use only 30x3 other 170 supercash goes useless. ""DONT USE THIS APP IF ANYBODY EXPECTS CASHBACK"" No stars....."
zeal malde,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jul-19,"Worst app ever.Would rate 0 star.However that option is not available.It deducts the money from your account immediately and not once but twice.Then there are no ways on how you can ask for refund.I got one option of help but that was through chat and u have to select frm predecided options.After selecting the options they just raise a ticket.There is no way to followup.I tried having a chat through same option but it shows that ""our engineers are trying to resolve. u cant speak to thm now"" worst"
Gyanesh Sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,02-Sep-19,"Worst payment app i have ever used ... 90% of the time ur money in mk wallet is of no use (eventhough you have thousands of rupees in your wallet) bcz for most of the transactions, balance will not get deducted from mobikwik wallet .... Instead it will redirect you, either to banking site or upi option ... My money in wallet is of no use .... Also their supercah policy is nothing but a way to dodge the users."
Rohith Shivanna,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-Sep-19,"Worst app do not ever use this app, I have added amount from account to wallet and tried refunding to account from last 5 days.I did not get my money back also I could not reach the help desk, no one is responding. I have raised to three tickets regarding this issue still I did not get my money and could not reach any one as well very bad customer service."
MD ALI MURTUJA,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Sep-19,Fake App. No response from cus ty omer care. Worst payment app. I have paid a credit card bill and same hasn't updated in my account. When we contacted to credit card company they told me that some companies hold the money for 72 working hours then after transfer. However I am using the credit card since a long time and paying bills from different app but this was my first transaction through mobikwik.
Logeswaran Anandan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Sep-19,"Dragged into this app through a flattering offer concept called ""supercash"". But they never let you use the amount from supercash wallet, other than for recharges(so many restrictions for recharge as well) and the supercash wallet balance expires in 3 months. I got Rs.900 in supercash wallet as cashback for purchasing a mobile and guess what, I was able to spend only 100 rupees in 3 months because of restrictions on supercash. IGNORE the app if you are opting in for CASHBACK in SUPERCASH WALLET."
Wilfred Gonsalves,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Sep-19,"Its a very bad experience I have with your Application, I have taken a boost credit and I have paid, there is no Emi deduction however you app still shows repayment and I am unable to apply for boost credit again, I have raised the ticket twice before however no reply nor there is a contact number to call, and you chat options are irrelevant. Is there anyone who is incharge or does that works automatic."

Gandu samajh k rakha hai Kya? When it's showing 'failed' in payment history, why my money is not refunded yet?"
Uddipta Nath,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Oct-19,"Worst app. They are thieves! I tried to recharge my phone, but it wasn't directed to the payment page until I ticked their rs.20 insurance policy of 1 lac. I was unaware at that time and mistakenly I proceeded for paying the recharge amount and insurance amount of rs.20. They deducted rs.20 from my bank account and even the recharge was failed. The message reads, you have entered invalid amount! Which I didn't. Because I always recharge my phone with that amount from other apps and it goes fine."
Govind Khandare,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Nov-19,Major issues in the app and no option to reaching customer care. I have been using mobikwik last 4 year but right now thinking to switch another app. Every time give error and task not perform well. I suggest everyone to move another app. Other applications has better performance and more service as compared with this app.
Mirza fazal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Nov-19,"Amount deducted but not added in mobikwik wallet, neither its showing last transaction. When i call to support team, after many hours call connected and they ask me to give screenshot of payment, I did but still no response even after 25 hours. They don't even deserved single star, call center is worst like hell, they will put your call on hold for hours. They are just playing with their customers. They will ask you to contact through app, but app support is like BOT. very worst support"
Kamal Juneja,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,26-Nov-19,Too much work needed. Most of gift card buying ends up failing n bam you have no money in account at times to buy stuff you wanted to with gift card until money is refunded which takes atleast 2-3days . Slow procedure and troublesome. Supercash not a smart move at all. You keep n keep on getting . Very difficult to use. My 2nd last option mobikwik i would say when i am out of offers in all other wallets. But can improve. Though airtel wallet is worse with no room i can see for it to improve.
Dexter Dexter,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Dec-19,It is a worst app there is no customer suppport....i have encountered many problems during transiction ...even after complete transiction it is not maintained in statement...

Karthik PS,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Dec-19,"Used to be good since I have been using it since its incorporated. now no super cash redemption stopped without any reason. KYC is done and upgrading KYC requires aadhar and PAN with same name. As south indians, mosly there will be confusions due to their last names. To my surprise I faced same issue. Banks, paytm and all similar wallet srvices and incometax linking too no problem happened. They seem to invent problems to evade supercash redemption. Uninstalling App."

For resetting a Pin I am waiting from 3 days and issue still not solved. Whereas for resetting a pin just few minutes are required in other apps.
abzal syed,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jan-19,"Hi to all this is my third update, please don't use this app, this is good app, but in this company working technical staff is no knowledge persons and they are taking any issues like a silly think and they don't want to clear the issue, still my problem not clear here. this is worrest in customer service, I am raise a ticket for 3 months back, still now it is in process, so this is worrest in service support.

Sunil Sharma,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,18-Oct-18,"In this app no such applicable rule for cash back utilization, it gives more cash back offer and deposit all cash back as super cash back but very unsatisfied with this policy. And if couldn't utilise your super cash back then it will expired. Suggest everyone to use another app."
Himalaya Mukherjee,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Oct-18,"Worst app for any financial transactions. I have done a transaction of INR 10000, transaction was failed. 19 days are over, still the amount is not refunded. There are no customer care team whom you can contact through phone.

Gopal Sampath,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Apr-19,good app but super cash option is waste 1 card for 1 month only if we redeem another card it is showing your monthly card exhausted. super cash option is waste and no use bt scratch card redeem process is testing customers patience. and insulting them do you want redeem card you could wait to get scartch amount upto 1 month dear team we want to get scratch card wait upto 1 month is this corret? your fooling costomers.

Sandip Rudra,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Oct-18,"The most 3rd grade upi app I have ever used. Really, I m serious. My suggest to all don't use this app for anything because of SuperCash concept. The most bogus n worthless concept of it. Plenty of burden to use this supercash.... I use Google Pay and Phonepe. Wow...what a upi app. Believe me, just use these app. U genuinely love it. Even if Google Pay offer something then the cash amount directly credit into linked bank account within minute. No waiting period at all. Phonepe is also good. I transfer amount, pay electricity bill, recharge mobile (even jio) through google pay and phonepe both within flash. I write lots... Just use all the others upi app and tally those. I once again bet that if any upi app have worst facilities then it is Mobiwik n it's SuperCash term is the most worthless. Thank u."

I have completed my kyc using otp which provides me 1 lac rupees limit per year. and that is enough for me. but this limit should reset on year completion but it's not happening and creating problem in adding money. now tell me the ways or to whom I should complaint to reset my yearly limit every year. because it looks like you are forcing me to do full KYC in order to use this wallet. I have used 98,549 rupees out of 2 lac rupees. then also the limit remains with me is 1,01,441 rupees not 1,441 rupees. and also is it right to ask or sand self attested documents online on mail? your customer support is really worse. if a person has any quarry, waiting of 2 to 3 days is normal. why can't you have live chat assistance or customer care phone number?"
Aurobindo Praveen Jonathan Arnold,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,16-Oct-18,"My registered mobile number has changed. I don't have my old mobile number.

Zayn Ryaz,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Sep-19,They have an awesome amazing fantastic customer care service. Where they said wait for 24 hours. But you've to wait for 10 days. Then they'll say your supercash or cashback has been credited. But when you check. It won't credited at all. They lied as good as you can't think about. Best customer care service in my life time.
Akhil subash,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Oct-19,Very useless and cheating app ever....

Rajiv Mondal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Jan-19,"Utterly disgusting app misleading users with so called Supercash scheme.

Dream X Gamer,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,25-Nov-18,"I'm changing my old review because, to change the super cash into your wallet there are too many term and conditions such as expiry date, scratch card and so many. So that's enough and useless. I'm not telling that MOBIKWIK is useless but and yes you can use it too easly but i think what can I tell about this."
Sanchita Kapoor,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-May-19,Worst app. I will recommend not to install the app. As the app gives supercash as a cashback. Which you can redeem on very less sites that to upto 5% of the amount. Also very slow support. I regret to use this app. I had 2k supercash but was of no use as other apps were giving more cashback. And the supercash also comes with a expire. So all the cashback was wasted.
JP'S World,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Jan-19,dont use this app. this app will take our personal information and for fund transfer we have to link our bank account and the most susceptible part is that with our mobile number they are able to find our bank account details. This app will take control of our phone and we could not use our other upi app. they also charge for transfer money from their wallet this is my experience.Dont install this dangerous app
Sumukh K,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-Feb-19,"Guys, This is an amazing application at present now. You can manage your finance in a better fashion and in a more efficient way.

So far the best app when compared to other competitors. Keep up the good work."

Ambuj Jaiswal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-19,The worst app ever seen. Worst cashback scheme. Even after full kyc lots of restrictions on transactions. Idiotic rule - they allow to add money from credit card but you can not use that wallet money as they have put lots of restrictions on txns. The most idotic is that you can not use credit card money to pay electricity bills. This idotic feature is only with this app. Don't install this app otherwise your money will get blocked in the app and you will not be allowed use your own money.
Praveen Malviya,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-19,bad bad.. I urgently needed to transfer money..

Bhavya Taiyou,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Nov-19,Ridiculous app this is. Seems like a fraud at times. My money got deducted and I was blocked out from Mobikwik even after inputting the correct OTP within a minute. Writing email to them as well didn't help. No other option than to put it on social media. Tried again yet still I am blocked with no fault of mine. This is consumer harassment. There is no resolution whatsoever. Do you even know that you are a service provider?

Put a radio button, earn sc or use sc. Even for payments originating from apps like Swiggy I'd like to control when to earn or use sc. Rest of the app is great, fix the above and it's a 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 service."
Regan D'souza,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Feb-19,"this the worst app i have ever seen. i was surprised when i saw the add that it gives 199 cashback, i immediately installed and recharged and than i came to know it was fake add that they provide. i didnt get any cashback. i regreted that i would have atleast received 50 cashback from my jio voucher. but i didnt use it and went for this worst option. whoever is using guys uninstall it.. its of no use. worst payment app ever👎🏻👎🏻"

Naaz Malik,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Oct-19,"Horrible Experience! 1. Kyc update is not at all working, aadhar nased authentication is not even opening 2. Worst ever customer care, only NAME is kwik, actually its kwik in introducing problems for you and not even close in solving those problems. 3. No easy acces to telephonic conversation, if required 4. User interface is confusing & repetitive 5. Withdrawal to bank is charged at around 4% by these people which is far far more than commission charged by bank. 6. Imps facility fails regularly"
himanshu joshi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Oct-19,"Cheaters. Worst payment app. Dont downloan it. Worst service. They will eat your money and never return the same.

They always have a disclaimer."
Debiprasad Pani,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,29-Oct-19,Very bad app. The worst most. Because it's not functioning at all as well as having no link to contact customer care helpline.

Sharad Ghule,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,10-Dec-19,I have paid credit card bill through upi but it is not credited in card and amount is transferred successfully to mobikwik upi.

Prafulla Landekar,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,13-Dec-19,"Quick, reliable & safe! This is really good wallet & consistently offering best direct cash discount on bill payments, fuel payment etc. Wonderful for travel, cab bookings as well.Financial services are also good. On star is less for ; 1)Use of Supercash (credit-debit for discount-expiry) 2)Offers / discount should also be required on movie tickets,insurance , credit card payment etc. 3) In shop & fuel pump it is not user friendly. Overall it is really useful wallet. Go for it. Thanks !"
Heenu Gupta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Dec-19,The worst payment app I've ever used. I paid to third party app using Mobikwik platform but used my Credit card for payment. The transaction failed. So my money should be refunded back to my credit card. But they have added my money in the Mobikwik Wallet. This is just a kind of Card Fraud. Unethical way to make people use their app. WORST digital payment experience. And I'm trying to connect with customer care. They are not responding after waiting for 10 mins. I don't know what should I do.

Jyoti Ranjan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Dec-18,"These people gives something called as supercash once you make payment by using mobiwik. One will think supercash is cashback but stop here, it is actually some points and each point is equivalent to 1 ruppee. But the tricky part is you need to redeem scratch card and interesting part is you can buy it only in their prescribed time that is at 12 pm. Dude, seriously do you think we are so free to look at the clock and open the app when it strikes 12? I have been opening this app for so many times by now, sometimes at 1 or sometimes at 1:30 or 2. Everytime they say scratch card exhausted, comeback next time."

Teerath Agarwal,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,15-Apr-19,"In my opinion, it is much better than paytm or any any other app. If it shows you 50% savings, then it gives 30%. Others show 10% and give 10%. This makes it worth using but also frustrating sometimes, but its worth it."
shirish herwade,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Dec-18,"Never use mobiwick for payment to other sites/apps.

Himanshu Midha,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,01-Dec-19,"Worst app i have ever seen. No option to remove upi account after adding it, and even no option to take money from wallet.. It's like trapping the customer by adding their money and upi account. They don't provide option to pay credit card bill via wallets. Indirectly they just want customer to use their app. My kind request to all don't install this app as I had very worst experience in few days only after I added money to their wallet. I promise this rating will go below 4 in few months"
Aarti Bhushan,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,17-Dec-19,"For some reason, the app keeps telling me device is registered with different account for UPI although I have never created a Kwik UPI id on this device.

NIDHI BANSAL,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Mar-19,never install this app it has made a system in which you get some amount of super cash after every transaction in the form of cashback you cannot spend this super cash directly you have to buy a voucher through which you can convert your super cash into money but you can only buy these vouchers only on sunday and only 1 in every month.and super cash which you get is like so that you can never redeem it completely as super cash expires after some time. So these guys are cheating with us
MASADUL SK,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Oct-18,"It is a very very bad app.you can't utilize your cashback amount when requre. You can use only 5% of total payable amount through this Supercash.this is realy bad.You can try another apps ie Freecharge,Paytm,Airtel payments.where you can fully utilize Your Wallet balance.No separate values b/w cashback and added money.So Don't use it until this feature change."

Same issue I mentioned to mobiwik team and I asked them to send person from KYC verification from your end Or call me ASAP but no one even bothered to contact me. They are sending useless emails to me.
Tarun Agarwal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Oct-18,"Worst Payment App ! When u say cashback, we expect wallet balance and not some imaginary currency (a.k.a supercash).To top it off, these guys are running lottery every Sunday to convert this imaginary currency into wallet balance. Plus when I uninstalled the app,they send as sms seeking a second chance with such insidious marketing ploy!"
Janmejay Brishketu,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Oct-18,"I started to like this app and use it after a long gap but it has disappointed me over and again. it has the worst customer support.No email, no customer care number.You can only get help via app that too is pathetic.I will strongly advise everyone avoid using this app. PhonePe and Paytm are better options."
Goldy behera,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Oct-18,Super cash is worst feature in which user has purchase scatch card on specified time.At a time one cannot get complete cashback amount. you will get only 10 rs out of which only 6rs will be added to wallet.people have have no time to waste for purchasing scartch card in bits daily. If the company don't interested in cashback then why to cheat app user.If you want cashback please don't use this app plz. This is my honest request. I am unable get back rs 80+ through cash back because of super cash. BAD BAD AND WORST APP FOR CASHBACK.
