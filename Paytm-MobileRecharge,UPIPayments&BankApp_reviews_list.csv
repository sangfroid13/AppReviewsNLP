Inamul Hussain,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,"Well done üëç finally paytm improve their application. That's great üòä Impressive üëå. The new version comes with very handy and simple interface. Easy to use it. I like it. So I giving 5 üåü rating for such a wonderful application. This application Smoothly running on my device. Actually I'm active paytm user since 2017. No doubt, I clearly justify that ,Paytm is batter than the other competitors."
Shashank Reddy Kallem,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,24-Jun-20,You guys keep on Changing the UI for every update. Stick with one UI. Paytm is the service which is used by everyone. Even some people who don't know how to read can understand how to use the app because the UI is very simple. But now with the new update everything is changed. Stick to one UI. Even though you change the UI just make sure that it is similar to the previous version.Note: The bottom navigation bar is the best thing in any application. Please bring back the navigation bar.
Bhargav Mane,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,Nice app. Last few months it's pushing notifications related to cashback offers on daily basis. The app doesn't allow for a granular control over which type of notifications are to be displayed through android 10's system settings. So the notifications can either be turned off entirely or leave it on with its daily notification.
TheSmallBoi Sam,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,"It was really difficult to rate it 2 stars because it is such a great app but the new update has pretty much destroyed it. You should understand that the UI appearance is secondary. More than good looking, an important app like this should be easy and comprehensive to use, like the previous version. With this new layout, I can't even find out the option to check my account balance. Please fix it and I'll rate it 5 stars, like it actually deserves."
Saitej S,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,"I liked the versatility of paytm. We can do basic things like recharges, bill payments etc that a UPI app should do. Besides, it can also be used to book flight tickets, bus, train, movie and what not. But I feel that paytm is still lacking the some features like individual payment room(like Phonepe and google pay where all payments to That particular contact are displayed in a chat like window). If Paytm introduces that feature, and betters the interface it would be a ""No Brainer""."
Ranjeet Srivastava,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,"A third grade app. Very challenging to use. Most of the time it doesn't work. Specialy while you have to pay to the marchant it stops responding... And you endup struggling to the access to the app. If you get the credit, and you try to transfer your money to bank, or charges a huge commission. For me it was charging 150 to transfer my money INR 2500 to my HDFC account linked to it. It is not a trust worthy app at all. 5 out of 10 times i endup by paying cash to my vendors as app malfunctions."
A Mohammed Arif,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,"I have very bad experience with paytm. When I tried to reset my upi pin I was unable to do it. Each time I tried to change it, it says to try after sometime. I tried several times and failed everytime. Each time I entered my last six digit of my card and expiry date and after getting the otp I enter it. After entering the new upi pin two times I click proceed an error message pops up and says to try after sometime. I'm fed up of this problem and unable to transfer money. Kindly resolve it asap."
aps chandi,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,"I am downgrading this app to one star. As for as giving away your money to others is a breeze but if you want to find a receipt, it is next to impossible. Once I found the receipt tucked in a unfathomable depth, I was able to see it but was impossible to share it or to take a screenshot. Even I could not download it. You suck. I am not wasting my time to give you some blah blah information, if you do not understand the issue, than it is your problem. I will look for better alternatives."
varun arora,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,"Good multipurpose app with pathetic customer care. This app is super handy and can be used for multiple purposes. The features and options are limitless until you get a error or issue somewhere, Then the horror starts and you find the dark side of this app. The so called 24*7 customer care. They prefer only tickets over calls and they do not care about your issue. On an average they will take 2-3 months. That too if you are lucky. Took me 3 months, Around 15 pings on their ticket and finally"
Nishant Sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,"I don't know why they keep changing their UI , I don't like it . I was using this app for over 2 years and now they don't allow to add balance through debit card , as a student I don't have a bank account, so I use Paytm account for upi payments. But now they want extra money for that . *uck yourself with app , their are lot of other alternative apps in options."
Sourabh Singh,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,20-Jun-20,"Editing my earlier comment. Paytm forces you to add money using non-UPI modes. It actually allows adding money using UPI only once after login. In subsequent attempts, the UPI option is deliberately hidden, forcing you to use other modes. Same happens for website. Reducing the rating from 3 to 2 as there is no improvement from the past. India is moving forward to UPI but Paytm is forcing India to go backward. Ticket creation option does not help."
Mohd Sohail Ahmed,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Jun-20,"Just made the mistake in the latest update by moving the ""Bank"" to a different placement. It seems less accessible now. Also, cannot use any other debit cards except RuPay cards to add money to bank. Really annoying. At this moment, the app honestly fits the criteria of being useless. Since I can basically use my bank with other UPI apps."
Rajesh Aggarwal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Jun-20,"What the hell are developers of this app trying to achieve? They are changing the interface of this app every 10-15 days. Due to this different payment options go here and there and I have to find them. It sucks my precious time. Moreover, this frequent interface changes have made this app very bulky and it lags a lot when in use. Now in today's update they have moved the PayTM Bank option somewhere else. It used to be at the bottom, second from the right. Now, I don't know where the heck it is."
Th√© Ken,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,"Paytm automatically logged out from my phone... And as its been a long time I couldn't remember it's password so I applied for password reset but it doesn't accept any of my password...even if It satisfies all it's policies (e.i. atleast 5 characters, special character, alphabet, numerical) ... Why don't I have freedom to set my own password?"
AMITAVA SINHA,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,"I'm using paytm wallet from January 2014, I saw a lot of updates to add more features. Now a days paytm is essential to daily life. From paytm wallet to paytm payments bank was a next level thinking. Today we can say that it's a massive part of DEGETAL INDIA. Today every Indians are using paytm app because it all in all with respect to others."
Zeeshan Anwar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Jun-20,Wow! After updating today the paytm wallet and paytm bank option has gone. What an update!! Also your customer care executives are unable to understand my simple problem. I am saying them that I am unable to transfer amount to some UPI id and it failed the transaction multiple times while earlier there was no such problem. Why so? This is my question. And your customer service officer is repeatedly saying that my amount is not deducted from my account.. Totally disgusting!!
Nikhil Panwar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,"Paytm used to be simple. Now there are too many features. This app has became so big that it's a total confusing mess. Can we just have a Paytm Wallet Lite version without all this paytm bank , Mall , Games nonsense. So many useless features. The app has just became a trashbag. Always lagging and slowing because of these million useless features."
Saurabh Jagtap,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,"Worst updating. Why does it downloads the update for so many times? Why doesn't it update the whole update in one go? It downloads somewhere around 1-2 MBs of package, and then again resumes downloading as if it's starting from new. Looks like it downloads multiple modules for a single app to update. It took almost 20 minutes to update an app of 30 MB in size, just because it was downloading like in multiple smaller packages."
Meenakshi Kishan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,I've always had great experience regarding payments and cashbacks. But recently this one thing that has made me rate it 1 star is that whenever i try to login again i never receive otp for hours. I have to try it a thousand times again and again to login. Also when i receive money now i don't get notifications through messages. I hope you guys will resolve my problem.
Amogh S,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,03-Jun-20,"It's still the same old app which is fine but the new interface sucks ass. It's gotten slightly slower and pages take a bit of time to load even with the best of internet speeds which is not a deal breaker but definitely noticable sometimes. Also, I still don't see better cashbacks offers like in PhonePe and GPay. Would like to see more offers to use this 'stead of them Seriously tho, the new interface sucks big time."
sunit trivedi,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,24-Jun-20,"Does well in doing transactions. Needs to reverse failed transaction automatically. First I wait for few days for reversal of failed transaction and after few days missed to report. Transaction of Rs 784/- to BSNL on 26/12/2019 twice.One was succesful and one was failed. But my money is blocked. Also security must be improved and investigation for stopping cyber crime hackers , who use name of PAYTM. I hope that they were getting data from old paytm workers."
Daniel Chongthu,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Jun-20,"Well the app was good and stood out from rest of the payment apps avaliable out there. Sadly you removed the functionality that enables user to transfer money from debit card (mastercard/visa) to paytm savings account which was the most significant functionality of your app and this functionality was the sole reason that made your app better and unique from other competitors. But sadly you removed it reducing your worth to ""JUST ANOTHER TYPICAL PAYMENT APP"". Please bring back that functionality."
Aditya Bagrecha,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,Using this amazing app from quite long but from past few days facing so much problem from Paytm wallet.. I'm not able to spend money from my Paytm wallet (no PAYTM WALLET option available) it always direct to my bank account being amount available in wallet. And I'm using updated version of it. I hope developers will take action for it it's a major issue as person can't use his own money!
Jeevesh Kishore Sharma,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,"Having loging in issue ,Each and every time I start the app it asks to create new password for Paytm app ,even If I already entered one .If again I tried to enter new password it shows incorrect password at the reenter password window .That's annoying . Each and every app startup I have login it again using otp login .That's a bit unconvenient .you are requested to patch this problem ASAP . Fix this bug I will increase my rating till then only Two stars . Thank you."
Sahil Garg,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,10-Jun-20,"The app is good. Really provides lots of options. Upi payment, payment bank, shopping, bill payment options, tickets. Everything is great. Thought I think it needs to improve from shopping point of view and customer care services need to be improved. The don't pick up calls at all."
Saurabh Rawat,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,what is this man... I've always been using this app it works very sincerely BT since yesterday I've been trying to book tickets multiple times in multiple cinemas...its not working its only showing please wait and then nothing is proceeding... I'm very much irritated ... previously also i booked tickets BT that time it worked properly... I'm totally unsatisfied right now...üò†üò†
maanav dais,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Jun-20,"Im not able to reset my paytm password. The moment i press the update option it takes me to a page saying ""the link has been disabled now. Please request for a new link"" I opened the link the very next moment when it was recorded but its not operating. It takes me on 2 pages to write the new password confirm new password. I mean i have to write it twice on separate pages new and confirm new password and after pressing update on 2nd page it takes me to 3rd page saying ""link is disabled now...."""
Srinibas Das,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,Everytime i tried to use paytm for my transactions i observed its really time consuming and uncertain. It really works very badly in slow internet. Please make the financial activities separate so that it becomes clutter free and fast. Otherwise so many good options are there. Hope i can make it my only option for banking in near future..
Nitin Malhotra,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,"Good but not secured - when you click on PAY, the SCAN QR CODE PAGE / CONTACTS PAGE appears just for a second and than the FINGERPRINT / PASSWORD PAGE appears. Within this 1 second, if you click on contacts or recent contacts, then YOU CAN PAY WITHOUT FINGERPRINT / PASSWORD. Did it 2-3 times for confirmation."
Niraj Yadav,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,"They're are simply fooling around with the app with every update. Stupid layout changes every time which are irritating more than anything else. And if that wasn't enough, their frequent bill payment reminders are just too much. Have stopped using Paytm altogether! There're much better alternatives out there in Phonepe and Gpay."
Atul Aryan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,One recommendation - Plzzz never never play spin the wheel game by giving them money because they always gives you less money than what you have paid for playing .Using this app since more than 5 yrs. No change in speed in 5 yrs. Same slowness & takes too much time to open and that sucks a lot .worst app ever.üò£üò£üò£
Subhojit Ghosh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Jun-20,What the hell !! The new update is absolutely ridiculous. I lost my every single details. Add money system is totally bad(visa card). It is taking more time to process any work. It's forced me to use another platform. Please fixed this as soon as possible.
amit g,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Jun-20,Super worst app its working fine on wifi not on mobile data send and receive is not working spoke to service provider still no use and i don't think so paytym will ever take the responsibility to resolve this issue they are of no use been checking for 2 days add send receive is not at all working on mobile data what rubbish app soo annoying i have money in my wallet who is supposed to pay me back???

Revanshi Sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-20,I like it but I recharged my phone number 5 to 6 times the recharge was not done but the my account money was reduced and they gives message that the recharge is done but it is not done . After that I called to their customer care number and their comes that the number is invalid. I am saying that they are taking our money . So please don't download it . Otherwise the same incident can be happen with you. Îß§Ïö∞ ÎÇòÏÅòÎã§ !!
Ajinkya Bawaskar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Jun-20,"To the UI/UX guy, please note that users have muscle memory and they hate it when one thing they're looking for keeps changing place every update. For god's sake you have the analytics of what features your users are using the most so just let them be and continue A/B testing with rest of the features. Please stick with one interface. Thank you."
ARDHENDU GUIN,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,"Hi, I have nothing to tell about the matters are there in the app but the way it perform is it not like Paytm way( using versions 8.10.8, mob: Asus max pro M2) It is taking much longer time than usual to open when it is urgently required, like the delivery boy asking for secure PIN at that time I am getting frastate to open my order, yes it is one of the reason I am trying to avoid shopping through Paytm."
dinesh sharma,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Jun-20,I'm not able to avail coronavirus insurance service throught the application. On clicking the coronavirus insurance on the paytm app it shows an error message on screen. PLEASE HELP AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE ASAP. Further my paytm helpline service is not working. I'm not able to click on the contact for help option. So I cant raise any ticket on the paytm app.
Raghav Sharma,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,Battery Hogging Bug in the latest update! Paytm is consuming unusually high battery since atleast the latest update. Just 13 mins usage is accounting for 33% battery usage of all apps. The second in this list is Google Chrome with 4h 36m usage time and just 23% battery usage.
Weird D I C K,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,"This appp is broken... Today I installed this app and tried to link my bank account with this appp.... And when I choose my bank and submitted... Nothing happened... I nearly waited for one hour.. At the bottom it shows"" Don't press back or switch to another app while we are verifying your details"" Though I choose my phone no. Correctly which is link with my bank account ... After that I tried again and waited for 7 min and again nothing happened... üò°"
Rajveer Singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Jun-20,I m using Paytm from last 4 years and there is no doubt the app working fine but after New update the app sucks alot.. Now I don't load money in my Paytm saving account from different account... It's say you have to use rupay debit card ...I don't know in today's world anyone use rupay cards ... Now it's sucks alot because of this ... I started using Google pay ... Plz Paytm admin change such things or no one use this app in future
Dinesh Paliwal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,"Deactivating the app. Its irritating when I add money it automatically added into PaytmBank not in the Wallet and when I want to use the money, Paytm bank disappears and only wallet shown and asked for the money from the linked account. When I have already added money in paytm bank and wallet then why the app always asked money from my bank account. Why does the available money be used. The app only wants our money to be added in it. I'm not happy and unistalling it permanently."
Ashutosh Gupta,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,"Implimentation of PayTM Payement Bank is insanly stupid! My last transaction got pending and their is no option in app to check that transaction's current status. Checking passbook, just reports Money Transferred with a big green colored tick on top! Confirming with customer care, reported that transaction is still pending. Such incomplete app implementation! You can't even check the complete account details (like complete account number) of account you made last transactions to."
Kamal Kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,28-Jun-20,Worst situation now. Please don't download or use this app for any travel vouchers. Last month I bought a TRAVELPASS with a flight ticket at a price of Rs.399/-. The pass was delivered but when booking the flight ticket with the pass it shows that pass needs to be purchased again. I raised several complaints with screenshots attached but all the complaints were closed without any solution.. I urge uh not to use this app. If your money goes then these customer care doesn't reply. Worst.
hina kathuria Manra,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,03-Jun-20,Worst app.. worst customer support... I was making regular transaction from this app but never got any problem since last 2 months I am not able to share my payment receipt and from last 10 days I raised a query to there customer support for which I am not getting any appropriate answer... Everytime they just say update the app or uninstall and reinstall... But don't know how many times.... My problem is still there...
kirty,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-Jun-20,"Earlier, we could add money through any debit card. But now they have removed that feature. Worst. Why would we keep paytm when we cant add money. whats thr use of paytm? Only Ruayp card is accepted. (Where will we get rupay card?) i mean who has? Visa or master card is so common that we can find it in any home. thinking - discontinue the use of paytm"
Raj Mohan,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,22-Jun-20,"Recharging facilities okay., but Transactions not possible from my Paytm wallet to my own Paytm registered bank account ! If it possible, You're taking interest for such transaction and Transaction not possible to any bank account without filling KYC details. Never ever ask Adhar number, PAN details etc.. which is not fair, as you're a third party application. Need much more improvements."
Sajahan Miah,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,"This is the best app ever made for payment you have all the options you want in this one app, you can trasfer money as others app do but, you can pay in this app through net banking which is not available in most of the others apps.. And you have all unique and all kinds of payment you want, example insurance pay, datacard pay and all kinds of bills pay and everything that you need and broadband too... You will just love itüòä As i love this app."
Hrushikesh Nibandhe,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-Jun-20,"Really disappointed when they removed option for transfering funds using any debit card , i tried to raise a complaint and all they said is close your app and start it again , use it on another device , According to them i should buy new phone everytime when such bugs are found and when they have no bloody solution for it ..!!"
Chitrasen,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,"03/06/2020: Paytm should allow customer to have the option of temporary turning off fastag. Multiple time wrong deductions due to wrong mapping of fastag. Though money reverted in 15 days but still fast mapping is not yet corrected though passed about 3 months. Responses to the requests raised in app are really pathetic and worse than AI bots with so much delay in resolution. Raised requests are closed without any resolution and suggesting a request Id which never existed in app. 05/06/2020: Instead of fixing its own mistake, got a message that Fastag is going to be deactivated unilaterally when all my request for activating after validating it properly. I am still interested to use the same sticker with PayTM. Is PayTM really listening?"
Kuldeep Rathaur,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Jun-20,First off all I going to give one star because of latest update. When I update paytm app it automatically log out. From that time I am trying to login but I am not able to log in into this app because of Otp. When I will fill password otp send successfuly. But I am recovering otp after 15 to 20 Minutes . I think the latest version is not good Please solve my problem.
Prashant Mahajan,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,23-Jun-20,Updates are making app worst. It used to be a small any easy app but after update you didn't add much special but make app confusing. And after update I'm not able to open my gild locker. So please kindly make changes in your app and try to make update smaller and useful.
Kasim Patel,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,07-Jun-20,"Feedback: Every month I pay as following: 4 mobile recharge 1 electricity bill 1 gas bill For each bill as mentioned above I need to do single transaction which leads to 20 minutes in total including OTP etc. Suggestion: By introducing ""Add to Cart"" features on your PayTM application I can add all my bills at once and with single transaction recorded on my bank account which reduce time of spending Paytm from 20 to 5 minutes. I hope this would help you to improve your application -Kasim"
Benson prasanth,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,Whenever I try to send to money to another's bank account it's shows that the upi pin I have entered in incorrect. 1st time I thought I had wrongly typed so I changed to new pin then I tried again It shows wrong pin what's the problem with it?. But I use the same pin to check my balance it's working. Please kindly resolve this problem.
Aashay Pandey,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,"Why have you removed the feature of adding money in savings account using visa debit card?Kindly bring back that feature. Other wise many users will try to move away from paytm.Being,one of the oldest users of paytm I request you to bring back that feature of adding money in savings account using visa debit card."
sanith reddy,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,Dont use paytm app in any transaction they will deduct money from us and keep in pending. After 2 days they will say money has been sent to the receivers bank. But i checked the bank statement and there is no record of money received in receivers bank. It means paytm keeps those money and they will say there is no problem in our side. We cant do anything because there office will be far away from us.
somraj soni,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,"Worst customer service I've experienced it took more than 50 minutes to connect to customer service.I've raised text complaint also in app but no response. It's regarding credit shell which now shows nil. You guys just improve your UI to make the app attractive once the transaction is done service is so poor. If it'd be possible i may have given zero star in rating. You guys should be ashamed of yourself, this is just customer harassment."
Prince Soni,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,16-Jun-20,So far app is very good but I raised a complaint on match where I told them that I'm getting a wrong name in display but till now they have not fixed the issue and no response from there end so customer service is very bad in paytm that the main reason for 1 star rating.
Peeyus Raj,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,"Totally disgraced I formatted my phone and reinstalled the first app Paytm. I logged in and decided to pay on a number from my bank account. I couldn't pay because at the end it said I don't have a bank account which is working. Now, I call the customer care, and explain everything to them, and those people say this is the wrong department, I am transferring your call to the concerned department. Now I have to explain everything to the second guy. The second guy says why are you using it."
mohit kujur,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Jun-20,I am giving one star because of the recent update... It was all fine until the recent update got rolled out.. before this update i was able to add money to saving account by my visa debit card but now i can't u can do it only if you have rupay debit card.. it will take 5% charges if u try to add money through visa or master debit card.. previous version was better.. thanks to paytm I have to shutdown my paytm saving account and rather go on with gpay or phonepay
Mohit Baid,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,"I am using the Paytm App to manage Fastags. Recently, without intimation, Paytm stopped the Fastag deactivate feature. While they continue to activate any deactivated tag, I am unable to deactivate active tags. The customer care's response is a simple, we have deactivated the feature. Makes Paytm unpredictable and unreliable if they arbitrarily disable such an important feature."
harish kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Jun-20,I liked using paytm before. Recently I had to reset my phone and reinstall paytm. After reinstallation I tried link my bank account to paytm using my mobile number. Every time I tried the verification failed and they charged me for mesaages twice for every try. I almost lost Rs.20.00 because of this and now I started to use other apps. Please solve this problem soon or your going to loose some good users....
Bhavesh Kumar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,"It's extremely disappointing to see they have started charging 2% for adding money from credit card, which virtually makes the app useless for me, and I'm sure many. At this time of crisis, I see it as an opportunistic and unethical move, and I guess it's better to use bank UPI directly or credit card than to continue using the services of an unscrupulous company like Paytm. I therefore intend to discontinue using Paytm app for good. Thank you this far. Goodbye!"
Prince chikara,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,08-Jun-20,Now a days they have smartly charging few % on every bill payment in a month also and restriction a limit of 10K monthly for transaction. Now a days we are not able to get the Net banking option for Adding a money in wallet . Guys...!! Don't try to grab the money from user without informing in prior and don't forget the USP of paytm.otherwise people will start looking for other options just like paytm.
Viraj Kulkarni,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,07-Jun-20,"It used to offer various discounts for all categories, now the offers are just mirage. Example - Offer title is attractive but when opened, we see the actual thing - minimum order value should be huge. Stopped using it as I'm not getting any attractive offer and discounts."
Amit Kumar,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,App is becoming worst day by day. I've to find bank options. My cashback coupons are also lost after update. I'm finding it worst to use this app. As you guys are making this app so complicated. Planning to uninstall and move to some other simple ui app.
Himanshu Dhingra,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,16-Jun-20,"Average app. It's showing you can pay bill of electricity, water, and also you can recharge your metro card. I have never get these done. Everytime I tried it showed me that there is some issue going on, you can try it later. So I think this is something you should work on."
Vadodariya I,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,I am unable to use my wallet balance for the payment bill of LIC premium.

Koustav Mondal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Jun-20,What's the hell problem with the paytm payment bank??? For almost one month i can't add money to payment bank from any debit card.. the card is okay as if i make other digital payments it works fine but where is the problem with payment bank???

Pancham Patil,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Jun-20,I am having issues using this app. I am not able to delink my account from the app. When I want to see the solution for the problem it is not listed in the options. Cannot even launch complaint. Useless app
Feroz Muhammed,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,04-Jun-20,"Google pay is the best. Don't use this app. Worst online Wallet, wish I could rate with no stars at all. There is no option to send money from your Paytm wallet to another Paytm user. Have to complete adhar verification. You have option to deposit money to your wallet from bank account but can't send it to someone on Paytm or even your own bank account. That's just ridiculously awful."
Amrit P,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Jun-20,"Paytm is the worse app now to use...the are taking convenience fee for paying electricity bill, so I opted other option like Phone Pe, Payzapp, they are the best and not taking any convenience fee..Paytm also increased charges to trasfer money to bank..most of the vendors are abounding to take payment via Paytm.. They say pay by Google Pay or another option like Phone Pe...Paytm has no future now..You are going towards end..even I am also going to uninstall this FARZI APP..I have options now."
Ritzz K,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Jun-20,"Paytm is the worst ever app. Whenever u make any payment & receive a refund , ur money doesn't go to your bank account. That money gets locked on the paytm voucher & not Paytm wallet so u can't use it for online shopping. U can only use it for making payment or at merchandized shops. Any transfer to ur bank account will cost u 3% of the amount. The customer service rep hangs up on u when u call them for help. If u email them, they give u a scripted answer repeatedly without reading the history."

manbendra singh,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Jun-20,The fast forward recharge feature of this app is pathetic.

Pulkit Parashar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,05-Jun-20,Why can't you guys have a stable UI and update it once or twice a year? Doesn't your PM know if you change UI too much it breaks UX for a common user? Every couple of month there is a new UI update!

Balance got deducted from my account but it wasn't credited to recipient's account. This was the worst experience because we both had no other option and we had no more balance in the account and had to borrow money from others. I'd have given -1 star if the option was available.

Requesting you to look into this as early as possible otherwise ill need to uninstall one of the app and which will not be the best option for me and I think this will be the problem for 50% of the users of PayTm.

Thameem Abbas,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-Apr-20,Makes me uninstall remote viewing applications. Should not do a blanket ban of all. User should have the ability to disable the warning. At least something on the grounds of a delayed disable. You can ask us to grant permission and a day later Paytm shall work on the phone. Do something like this so scammers cannot instantly get anything.

Manish Agrawal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,13-Apr-20,"One of the slowest app around. Trying to do everything you have made the app very heavy. BTW why do you give offers/coupons, they are practically junk. Authentication needs to drastically improve. You can't log me out Everytime I try to do transaction. There are better ways to enforce security."
sachin shekhawat,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,if u are handling people's money than you are supposed to be more responsible and accountable 1.there should be account balance after every transaction in passbook 2.there should be customer care representative to talk to instead of computer.its MY money I want to talk about. Raising complaints interface is not at all user friendly on paytm 3.I don't know how my Paytm payments bank account was opened and how my savings account got linked to Paytm. And worst part I can't remove them.
Subroto Mukherjee,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,08-May-20,"I am surprised to see that Paytm is only keeping good ratings for people and removing all the negative ratings. While I have always liked their app for their convenience and the innovation around instant cashless payment, I have always hated some of the inconveniences it carries. Often times it ends a session while you're in the middle of a transfer or recharge. It randomly decides to add or remove the NetBanking option in its payment options."
Rahul Goel,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-May-20,"App is good, user friendly but one big missing thing is Customer care...One can not easily trace whom to contact; the standard FAQ are of little help as all issues are not covered!!

ThePaleRider,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Jun-20,The developers have no common sense. Mandatory Location access? Seriously ? Phone is a wireless device and hence the person having the phone can go where ever they like. You can't possibly detect erratic behaviour unless you're spying on your users. You've successfully ruined a good app. Edited on 15th . Still suspicious behaviour from app and developers.

Anurag Bartarey,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-May-20,"How is that every time when something needs to be done in emergency your app fails and will log out. Your very bright product managers have designed logging process in such a great way thinking that everyone has greatest memory to recall a password. This app is such a blessing in India because I'd like to start my day with super frustration and then shout at random people, because of one local (chinese) app, What have you made our lives into!"
Prakher Srivastava,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,22-May-20,"Though it gives freedom of doing various things on one platform but when it comes to any refunds, nobody can beat them the way they steal your money. Paytm always replies with drafted texts, no active platform to listen to the customer. Infact there system is such that you can't reach them and will always be ignored. They are the leaders in hiding the money. Pathetic. Users should use different platforms for different services but not use paytm because once money is stuck, it is always gone."
Yathindra S Rao,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,26-May-20,App has became too heavy now with all the gaming options because of this application performance has came down.

Deepak Ahlawat,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,15-Apr-20,Forcing to share location is a pathetic idea for an app. This has become a complete nuisance for me and does not allow me to login. So I am uninstalling it right away. My final questions to paytm developers: 1) Why do you want me to automatically register to UPI. A customer should have a choice to do so. 2) Why does paytm bank or an app want to intrude in privacy of customer by forcing to share their location? 3) Why does this app logs me out after an upgrade and then asks me to re-login?
Ravindra Babu Dasari,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,27-May-20,"Have been using #Paytm for long however today i have decided to reduce my dependence of it for many things.

Rahul Aundhakar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,17-Jun-20,"GOOGLE SHOULD GIVE - RATING OPTION. It's worst than I thought. The support sucks, they ask otp/passcode to proceed and then say don't share it with anyone. IT'S VIOLATION OF OUR SECURITY. Why do I need to share OTP to them. You don't know whom that otp is from. And the customer care executives are lire, long waiting time and they say jst few seconds. And then call gets disconnected automatically. Most of the time Money gets stuck and the process is too much lengthy as you see in other reviews."

Do extra high charges on transferring money to bank, deduct money when transferring money to merchants without giving any notification about deduction and charge very high comparatively to other methods on paying fees too.

Rohit Kheria,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Apr-20,Never use Paytm for bigger amount transactions like Railways or flight bookings as for any future cancellations the refund would keep lying in Paytm Wallet only and not credited to cards used to make the payments and Paytm would charge a hefty 5% + taxes to transfer to your bank. There is no appropriate category in your 24*7 support to raise tkt for this issue. Pls provide email id. If the money still lies with u in the wallet maintained by you then how come it's a refund. It's not true refund!!

Akash Shaw,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,31-May-20,App is very slow even network is very good .I m waiting for transfer the money from Paytm 20 minutes to open in payment options ... Even after 20 minutes I post about the but there is nothing happen in site..lot of problem to money transfer

Vishnu S,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,23-Apr-20,Performance of the application is very poor. It's getting slow most of the time like old samsung phones. I'm facing this issue for past one year. Many people face this issue and Paytm should update the app.
Pratibha Joshi,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,15-Apr-20,New updated version doesn't have feature to scan qr from gallery. How one can make payment to another merchant without physically having qr code in this quarantine period. Previous version has the gallery option so i recommend plz change the updates of this version.
Ravi Duvvuri,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-May-20,"I don't recommend the app. There are better apps out there with better service. You will never see or talk to a human service agent if you had a problem. They can't even let reset your password at your leisure. I am stuck in saudi arabia due to lockdown, with no way to reset the password, until I get back to India. Better avoid it. They will give u a link for contacting their support. It will take you to a place where you will keep go round and round like a dog chasing its tail. So, BiG NO."
Sid 03,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,01-Jun-20,"Unresponsive customer care. Experiencing error quite often while loading payment confirmation either directly via this app or via Paytm mode in a 3rd party app. KYC needs more options, like aadhar etc. The Landing screen is much crowded too."

Deepu Nair,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,14-Apr-20,Very sorry to give 1 star because there was no zero or negative option. These idiots made an app which can trouble to a normal indian. There is no simple method to check history of payment. If a person pays via QR code and press back key unknowingly then he/she will have to dig his brain to find out the payment history as this is India you people should make a simple option as everyone can easily use the main things which a app should have.

Ranjan Sharma,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,01-Apr-20,"Sadly PayTM has started charging 2% fees on loading wallet via credit card if more than 10000 in a month. The reason they say is multiple users using Paytm to get free credit by using credit cards to top up their digital wallets and transferring the money back to their bank accounts at zero transaction cost. There should be a method to detect & charge fees only in case if people are transferring the wallet money loaded via credit card to their bank, why burden all users with same policy? I will be forced to stop using Paytm now & look for other digital wallet options."
