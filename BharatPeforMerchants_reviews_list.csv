Ravinder Singh,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,29-Jun-20,"I am a Author and have been using it for the last several days, which is a very good app. A Lots of Thanks Bharatpe."
Avinash Kumar,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,01-Jun-20,"I am using this app for last 2 months, the app is good but doesn't work properly. Many times I face this problem that when I open ""Interest a/c"" page, it buffers round and round with ‚Çπ sign and then it's only a full-white screen, nothing else. When I try 2-3 times, then the details appear. I think you should work on it."
Rakshith Rinku,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,"No proper support is being provided by the support team.... I have been reaching out once in every week and asking my queries, regarding my extra income card. They just say your problem will be sorted out. But since 3 months I didn't receive my card. Hire a strong support team who can answer the queries or train the existing team properly. I have written to your support mail many times describing my issue with the suitable screenshots, they don't even feel responsible to respond back atleast."
Yogendra Dwivedi,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,01-May-20,With the new update it seems there are many bugs which needs to be sorted. One of them is when we click on interest account it processes however nothing happens and screen is completely white. It happens quite frequently but not every time. If we try 10 times you willl see white screen atleat 6 to 7 times. Please have this fixed.
Jay Maurya,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,20-May-20,Loved the 12% interest account. Few suggestion: Add the description on your website as how BharatPe assures that money of it's customer is in safe hand. Secondly about XtraIncome card - BharatPe can issue virtual card as an alternative to physical card during the Lockdown. Transaction alert on whatsapp is good feature but Email statement (weekly or monthly) will be an amazing thing for merchants to keep the record of book documented for future reference.
shyni mundangadan,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,Last 1 Week I have been raising a complaint like OTP not receiving while instalation. No proper response and unable to resolve this issue. Due to issue I am unable to install the app in my mobile and unable to check the total amout. Very poor response.
Punit Jain,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,01-Jun-20,App is good . But the problem is sometimes it does not msg on WhatsApp. And some time it also does not give msg about payment received. It also does not show shop name to the customer. Due to this sometimes it is confusing to know that customer is paying to us. He can also pay to other and can say that I have pay to this qr code.
J S Kumar,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,03-Jun-20,First let me tell you the app works very well but there are small problem issues 1) I have registered in the company name but when I try to send payment link it goes in my individual name and tried to ask solution from your customer care the answer I received is it can't be changed. Now you as a client would you make a payment for individual name and there is no option also for changing or editing kindly let me know the suggestion 2) I am not able to change the settlement for instant
Peram koteswar,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,10-Jun-20,"12% interest account is great, can receive money from any payment application, providing cricket bats and balls...etc reinforcements are well....

Satyabrata Behera,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,Very nice app & the helpdesk is very helpful. Basically the app is most believable. Money is safe with them. And they assure the customer to sort out any problems if ever created as soon as possible. Also they give very good interest on investment. For better they are working.
Anbudan Vairam,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,12-Jun-20,"Worst customer support team. Unable to send payment link via sms. They said that, update your kyc details. But there is no kyc update link in this app. All hindi speaking people in customer care doesnot support anymore. No email support also. Somany weeks passed. No response."
Amay Kubal,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,"So good so far. I have a suggestion about Interest account. One should have an auto debit feature that will put Interest directly in merchant accounts on the regular interval one selects. Daily, weekly, Monthly etc."
Deepika VB,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,09-Jun-20,Never take loan from this app. They are forcing to pay due amount during this time. (covid 19) Executives work here come and sit in the shop until we pay. The only way to get rid of them is to commit suicide in front of them. Never ever take loan nor use this app.
Himanshu,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,07-May-20,Well this application is really suck most of the time ...when you click on 12% interest section... Hope the team will try to resolve this problem forever...but the reality is it yet to be resolve after multiple update since then.... Absolutely poor from the app development team.
Nikhil Mehta,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,06-Jun-20,"Settlement dint take place on time and they take atleast 24 hours to even settle normal payments, whereas other players do it immediately or on the same day atleast Now even after 24 hours settlement failed, now again need to wait 48 hours door settlement as they have reinitiated it, now don't know when will i receive my money Will ignore their portal from now on"
m.shashi kanth,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,28-May-20,"Very good application and the way they are working is good and make it user friendly app(allow transactions to send and receive money, bank transfers,create wallet, recharge offers or any scratch cards, referrals offers....etc) such that more people can use it."

Please fix that technical bug as soon as possible, later on I'll change my Star rating"
Vikash Kumar,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,11-Jun-20,"This app changing my earnings way, interest on deposit money is more than 3X rather than saving bank account interest. Total payment collected through QR code has settled by end of the day So this is very awesome platform to collect money through QR code"
Prabhat K.,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,04-Jun-20,Till now I didn't face any major issues in using this app. But many times it doesn't update daily collection instantly. Also the support email address doesn't respond. I need another one to contact you guys....
Rushikesh Ladkat,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,25-Jun-20,After update the app is always displaying no connection this is rediculous..
Manoj Kumar Patra,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-May-20,Awesome Payments App! Really it is very Easy to receive Payments from Customers and that too without any Transaction Fees with Instant/End of the Day Settlements. Just waiting for the BharatPe Loans to get activates in my area (767001) that will add more sweetness to the Above Features and BharatePe App for me.üòÄüëç.
raviteja rules,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,18-Jun-20,"I couldn't even open my account. Everything I enter my bank details it says ""mobile verification limit exceed"". Very disappointed with customer service also."
Naidu Kantj,Rated 3 stars out of five stars,26-Apr-20,"Very very problem in changing bank account. Please change your rules in changing bank account in bharatpe. Please make easier to users... Change it like........ 1) old account number 2) OTP of that registered bank phone number 3) New account number. 4) OTP of the registered phone number.

Masti magic comedy,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,02-Jun-20,"Everything is fine but only one thing is fake that instant money transfer from invest account to your account which is very bad, if you need money urgent basis you can't get it.

Paresh Baviskar,Rated 5 stars out of five stars,26-Jun-20,Very usefull and friendly app And also reverts get more to your expectations....
asfak virani,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,19-May-20,"Useless service they are saying that daily settlement will be done but not doing same and the reason they says the server issue and now wait for next 72 hours it means they will block your money for more 72 hours after one day of transaction done withot any responsibility, and during that time period if you bear any charges from bank then bharat pe feels sorry for it."
Dorjee Wang,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,11-Apr-20,"I have a small stall was using this app 2 times the money was not credited in my account when i called the help line they said it has been credited from their side something might have gone wrong with my bank but when i inquired in the bank they said its not their fault i lost 2250 , and 880 it might be a small amount but me being a street hawker it means a lot to me i m using paytm now n i m happy with their service don't know why my idol salam bhaijan is their ambassador"

I mean with which bank you are authorized or in partnership with?? Please mention your partnership in Terms and Conditions atleast as I did not find any bank associated with bharatpe. And believe me that the biggest QUESTION MARK !!! on BharatPe that how you are providing a massive 12% interest without any lock in period.

But not like that in a grocery store. In Card Swiping Terminals. We receive a daily settlement report through a mail. So we keep a tab on all the transactions. In your QR System. We don't receive a Mail of Transactions and Settlement report daily. Or either there is no way

rahul tambitkar,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,20-Sep-19,"Worst app ever. All account holders on bharat pay kindly try to signout your respective accounts, you won't be able to. All u have to do is uninstall the app without singing out. While signing out u are asked to verify your phone number and then u ll receive an OTP. Kindly check the OTP message completely. It say 'BharatPe: xxxx is your OTP to register yourself on BharatPe Merchant App. So the OTP u have received is to register urself and not for signing out. Customer care executives are lame."

Krishna Kumar,Rated 2 stars out of five stars,12-Jan-19,"Not happy with the present version of Bharat Pe. Firstly I thought this is something like BHIM which can support multiple bank accounts. But came to know that, it supports only one bank a/c per one mobile number. That is a big inconvenience. After failing to link my joint account to my mobile through BharatPe, I tried to link my personal account as a test case. It worked. But then, I see that it can be linked only to one account. So now I am unable to purge this test case one and use BharatPe for the one which I really wanted. No clear answer from the support group. Just like adding a bank account to BharatPe, there should be a provision to remove it also."
A Google user,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,17-Dec-18,Loved it. Very much improved since I last used it but now I can say it's really useful app and services. Great experience so far. .A few suggestions: Please see if you could comeup with BharatQR instead of simple UPI QR. Also if payer could see the company name instead of BharatPe Merchant in UPI app. Right now BharatQR app doesn't work with current QR but I believe UPI payments is also possible with BharatQR format.
Najmul Haq Shaikh,Rated 4 stars out of five stars,16-Sep-19,"Edit: Now working after re install of the app. I tried this app, but after mobile verification it asked for bank account verification.

Don't know how this app works, there is no contact us option either."

But i am still waiting for it. Wrote emails to it . Which are still unanswered. Contacted their sales promotional executive but he said that as u have regd via app he is not interested as he doesn't gain anything from it. He infact told me that though the app promises that qr code will be delivered in 48 hrs it takes not less than 7 days to reach you physically. So beware

When a customer pays u based on scanning or from Google pay a faltu code comes which neither u know that it's is URS or someone else.

akshay agrawal,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Aug-19,I suggest not to download this app.. Let me explain how this app works 1. It asks you to register yourself/your business on the app 2. It accepts the money from your client to itself first 3. Then it transfers the money from from its account to merchant's account Example:- customers account => app's a/c App's a/c => merchant's a/c So it acts as a medium of transfer without connecting customer's and merchant's accounts directly.
Vishal Singla,Rated 1 stars out of five stars,21-Sep-19,Worst experience with this app Customer care doesn't solved my problem even after one week Their agent handed me a wrong QR code due to which my payment isn't recieved in my account but got deducted from customer account.
